Ludicrous quasi-proto-sf planetary voyage to Jupiter. The planet is inhabited by huge winged creatures very much like angels, who are immortal and sexless because they don't need to reproduce, and live in a society that is the author's version of a blend of the three polities, grounded in a religion that seems strangely Christian, despite their ignorance of the founding story. Their society is seen as idyllic, but wholly inappropriate for Earthly humans. Reynaert thinks the best humanity can hope for is a form of Christian socialism.
