title: "Mordecai Roshwald - Level 7"
---

Level 7 is the deepest layer  in a bomb shelter, and the novel describes the feelings of a military officer  closeted there as the world disintegrates above him in nuclear holocaust.
 
For John Pilgrim  this was a "horrifying  picture" of the all too probable future. Later anarchist reviewers welcomed its  republication, and called it "The Finest Novel yet written on Nuclear War in its  aftermath". (Pilgrim 1963, Bates 1981, anon. 1983)
