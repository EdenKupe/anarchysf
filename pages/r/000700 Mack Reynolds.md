John  Pilgrim found the Ultima Thule of _Planetary Agent X_ to be "delightful".  (Pilgrim 1963) In the United Planets there are said to be several run on an  anarchistic basis. One is a planet called Kropotkin, with Bakunin the capital.

In _Commune  2000 A.D._: 

"The government, through technocratic means, has eliminated the need for most individuals to work, and has instituted a Universal Guaranteed Income. Only those who come out on top when taking tests to determine their Ability Quotient are able to obtain jobs. More and more, jobless individuals join communes and pursue their own interests—there are communes for homosexuals, lesbians, artists, nudists, kids who hate everyone over thirty, swinging singles, and many others. A government official objects that "An increasing number of the communards don't participate in even the civil elections. Most aren't eligible to participate in the guild elections, because they hold no jobs, but they don't bother to vote in the civil elections, either. To put it bluntly, they're anarchists." After the main character, who has been assigned to investigate the communes, discovers that the communards are in a conspiracy to institute anarchism by eliminating the political state and transferring democracy to the economic sphere, one member tells him that they prefer the term libertarians.  Say anarchist to most people and they think in terms of bomb-throwing fanatics. (Reynolds was an activist with the syndicalist Socialist Labor Party.)" (Dan Clore)

_Amazon Planet_ received favourable  mention from Lessa, Takver & Alyx, in 1978.

_After Utopia_ transports a man from the mid 20th century to 2045, where a post-scarcity society has eliminated work, money, and government, and is described by a character as anarchism, although the protagonist later revises this as more properly "a highly refined type of syndicalism," given that it has an International Congress of Guilds. Society has become complacent and hedonistic, and the man has been abducted in order to 
recharge and refresh the public realm, based on his experience of a harsher world. The 'utopia' has odd features, like the continued popularity of hunting and other blood sports; and Reynolds's descriptions of the universality of what the 1970s imagined as free love now read as embarrassingly crude and patriarchal. It has the merit, as noted by <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Contemporary_Anarchist_Studies.pdf">
Randall Amster</a> (p292), of cautioning, as anarchists do, that "'There is no such thing as Utopia. . . . It is something man strives for, runs after, but he never gets it in his grasp. As soon as he reaches one milepost, there's another.'"

_Lagrange Five_ is set on a space colony run on  broadly syndicalist lines, though with a population consisting only of Earth's  intellectual elite. China Miéville included it in his list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060216193945/http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/50socialist/" rel="bookmark" title="Fifty Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction Works That Socialists Should Read"> Fifty Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction Works That Socialists Should Read</a> (which was  also copied to the anarchysf mailing list in 2002), describing it as "examining  a quasi-utopia without sentimentalism". It's also listed in Bould's _Red Planets_ reading list.
