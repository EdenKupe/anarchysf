_The Child Garden_ is described by _SFE_ as "one of the sturdiest monuments of 'Humanist'; sf". Jesse Cohn's _<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jesse-cohn-anarchism-and-the-crisis-of-representation"> Anarchism and the Crisis of Representation</a>_ refers to it as an example of the way that his novels "tend to feature numerous little incidental encounters with people drawn from the register of the ordinary, the kinds of everyday encounters that are normally reduced to the single dimension of utility [ . . . ]: the person who would ordinarily appear to us as a more or less useful object, a function, an It, manifests instead the sort of qualitative dimensions and independent subjectivity of a You, before vanishing back into the textual background. The glimpsed fragment of another life prompts us to imagine the unimaginable plurality of lives unread, of worlds unseen by us."
