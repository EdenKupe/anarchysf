From an on-line interview:

"Faliol: Are you a libertarian anarchist?
KSRobinson: No, I am a green socialist, roughly. A utopian. I don't like libertarianism as I understand it because it seems to keep private property, police, and other aspects of the current system, indeed it seems to keep capitalism.
Faliol: I myself agree with Chomsky's ideas.
KSRobinson: I like Chomsky's writing very much. He should be more represented in mainstream American press; it's a sign of how bad they are that he isn't. But I still don't like libertarianism. Nor anarchism either, though at least that one has a nice idea at its heart.
Faliol: Have you read Bakunin?
KSRobinson: Yes, I have read Bakunin, maitre'd of anarchism."     (Dan Clore)

Robinson is sufficiently sympathetic to anarchism, however, to have written the introduction to Killjoy's 2009 _Mythmakers & Lawbreakers. Anarchist writers on fiction_. Here he describes himself as "a leftist, interested in opposing capitalism and to changing it to something more just and sustainable", who has "once or twice tried to depict societies with anarchist aspects or roots". He spoke on 'The Politics of Science' at the 2010 Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair, and again on 'Science and Capitalism' at the Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair in 2013.

In a 2018 <a href="https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/interview/the-realism-of-our-time"> interview</a> Robinson again gave his views on anarchism:

"KSR I’m a statist; I don’t believe anarchism is a way to get through the next couple of centuries. I thoroughly approve of anarchism’s ultimate goal of the total horizontalisation of power but, to me, anarchism is a horizon that is centuries out.

"HF At least one literary critic has coupled your name with Murray Bookchin.

"KSR I’ve read Bookchin and I admire his work. I’m thinking more of anarchisms that conflate capitalism and the state. I separate them, just as I separate capitalism and science. I’m also thinking of the anti-humanism of certain anarchisms, those that turn into libertarianism very easily in an ugly way, those that say it doesn’t matter if six billion people die because then we’d have a sustainable number. What’s good in anarchism is the idea of a complete horizontalisation of power and prosperity. It’s a great long-term horizon to aim for. It’s like utopia itself. I’m a utopian, but I wouldn’t say I’m an anarchist because I don’t think a state monopoly on violence is a bad thing at this point in history. It’s better than the alternatives, better than chaos, better than the freedom to burn as much carbon as I want. I think that carbon use should be legislated and controlled and priced, and anarchy doesn’t provide a way of doing that."

'Lucky Strike' is included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>, where it is described as "A fine if short parallel-universes novella on the morality of 'just following orders.'" It's also included in the <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">Think Galactic</a> reading list. The slim PM Press edition includes an additional essay on historical determinism and alternate histories, and a useful interview with the author by Terry Bisson; this edition was "very highly recommended" in Teflon's <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/review-lucky-strike/"> review</a>.

The _Three Californias_ trilogy depicts three different futures for Orange County; for <a href="https://bamahrab.wordpress.com/2016/05/19/the-politics-of-science-fiction-kim-stanley-robinson-and-the-rise-of-solarpunk/"> B.A. Mahrab</a> "This series delves into the different types of future scenarios we may very well face as a species—each one completely within mankind’s ability to create now, and none of which fall outside the realm of plausible possibilities." _The Gold Coast_ is described as an "exemplary critical dystopia" in Seyferth's '<a href="https://www.academia.edu/4377644/Anarchism_and_Utopia">Anarchism and Utopia</a>'. See also <a href="https://web.duke.edu/polygraph/kimstanleyrobinson.pdf">Canavan, Klarr, and Vu</a>, and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/123217/new-utopians"> Heer</a>.

The _Mars_ trilogy represents "Basically an anarchist revolution & construction of society" (posting to anarchysf). For Lewis Call the trilogy is "Robinson's vision of an anarchistic Mars"; Robinson's gift economy is "the most interesting anarchistic element of Robinson's meticulously detailed Martian society", "the articulation of a way of thinking about politics and economics which is radically new, and yet also profoundly old." (Call, 2002; see also Huston's '<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/shaun-huston-murray-bookchin-on-mars">Murray Bookchin on Mars</a>'.) James Gifford, in _The Palgrave Handbook of Anarchism_ [p581], notes that "While Robinson has predominantly aligned himself with Marxist social critiques, he has remained open to anarchist paradigms, and he addresses antiauthoritarian values extensively in his _Mars Trilogy._" _The Martians_ is a collection of stories and poems closely linked to the trilogy. Two of the pieces included are of particular interest: 'The Constitution of Mars', and 'Some Worknotes and Commentary on the Constitution'. The constitution reworks elements of the US, Australian, and Swiss constitutions in a pretty systematic way, in which the most interesting innovation is that the duma (roughly equivalent to the US House of Representatives) is selected by a process of sortition rather than election.

_Antarctica_ was recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel 'Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science Fiction' at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009. Set in Antarctica in the near future, environmentalism and sustainable living are central, with much interest shown in the formation of cooperative and anarchic social systems. From the same mould as the _Mars_ trilogy, it has been nicknamed '_White Mars_'. A vivid and unforgettable paean to the cold wilderness of the continent.

According to <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020520/rice_and_salt.shtml">one reviewer</a>, Robinson's alternate history _The Years of Rice and Salt_ includes a discussion of anarchist ideas of a post-scarcity economy. There's also some discussion on this novel in an online
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/iry3w4/roderick_long_interviews_kevin_carson/"> 
conversation</a> between Kevin Carson and Roderick Long (starts at 1:13:50).

For <a href="http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2137">Maeve66</a>, writing for the US Solidarity, Robinson's _Capital Code_ trilogy, on the theme of climate change, is "well worth reading, for the science, and the potentials and limitations on electoral reform as a solution to anthropogenic climate change." <a href="https://bamahrab.wordpress.com/2016/05/19/the-politics-of-science-fiction-kim-stanley-robinson-and-the-rise-of-solarpunk/"> B.A. Mahrab</a> sees this trilogy, among other Robinson works, as central to the developing sub-genre of solarpunk.

_Galileo's Dream_ is an exceptional blend of sf and historical fiction/biography, and one of Robinson's best works. <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/a-few-favorite-atheist-science-fiction-novels-and-books-on-cults/">Teflon</a> describes it as "A well executed time-travel novel involving Galileo 
and his conflict with the Catholic Church and the Inquisition." Elsewhere he particularly recommends this work and _Aurora_, while noting that neither is related to anarchism.

The marvellous _2312_ is included in the <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">Think Galactic</a> reading list, and viewed as "anarchist-themed-sci-fi" by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/536628085">David Agranoff</a>.

_Aurora_ is a generation starship novel with a powerful message from the author, namely that "Earth is the only home, and fixing our relationship with it is the only possible solution to the anthropogenic mass extinction event that we are in the process of starting." [<a href="http://www.publicbooks.org/interviews/earth-first-then-mars-an-interview-with-kim-stanley-robinson">Robinson</a>, interviewed by Dave Haeselin]; escaping Earth's problems in this way he sees as an "impossible transcendence". <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/10/16/review-aurora-by-kim-stanley-robinson/"> Teflon</a>'s response, however, was at best lukewarm: "worth reading", and "Recommended (barely) for its political and ecological points."

_New York 2140_ is set in a water-logged New York post-climate change. Perhaps not his strongest work, but "Unfettered capitalism and the practices that led to the 2008 economic meltdown are squarely in Robinson’s crosshairs in _New York 2140_, where the future is no less unscrupulous than the present" [<a href="https://singularityhub.com/2017/01/06/new-york-2140-is-a-sci-fi-vision-of-the-world-reshaped-by-climate-change/">Singularity Hub</a>]. Facebook's Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, and Solarpunk Anarchists, drew attention to its publication. <a href="http://news.infoshop.org/reviews/review-new-york-2140/">Infoshop</a>  has re-posted Roderick Long's C4SS review, which is less enthusiastic: "I highly recommend _New York 2140_ as a beautifully written, richly allusive, perpetually engaging and provocative novel. But I cannot recommend it as a lens through which to view the causes and likely cures of the social ills that beset us."

_Red Moon_ features a moon mainly colonised by China, with a lot of discussion of political philosophy and the meaning of democracy. The political context is intentionally opaque, and Robinson has explicitly said he sees this as a realistic counterweight to the fantasy revolution of Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_. A review in <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/red-moon-red-earth/">_New Socialist_</a> highlights one scene set in 'the free crater', which features a community organised as a "documented anarchy", its activities and decisions recorded to a blockchain distributed ledger. The novel's publication was the occasion of an intelligent and informative interview in the <a href="https://chireviewofbooks.com/2019/01/07/kim-stanley-robinsons-lunar-revolution/">_Chicago Review of Books_</a>. <a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-iii-on-the-shores-of-communist-h-e-avens/">
Sethness</a>, in The Commoner, has a couple of paragraphs on _Red Moon_.

_The Ministry for the Future_ is an outstanding novel on the theme of the climate emergency, set in the near future, and projecting the possible course of how it may be overcome. Unusually, I think this is the only science fiction novel to have had two distinct reviews published by the Institute for Anarchist Studies, both in June 2021. <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/ministrykatsiaficas/">George Katsiaficas</a> expresses disappointment, saying :

"I wish I could be more positive. Robinson’s work certainly has good buzz and occasional spark. He is a revered figure for many of my friends. My disappointment is the same problem I have with our society: technological overdevelopment has not been accompanied by deep thinking about our social reality. Robinson’s failure to give his characters any real depth can be correlated with his inability to comprehend the need for social revolution, for the transformation of everyday life, not simply legislation. [ . . . ] Robinson may well be “one of the most important political writers working in America today,” but it should also be said that the universe of discourse in this book stifles the expression of utopian possibilities. When even one of our most speculative fiction writers fails to imagine a world already anticipated in the praxis of tens of millions of people, our road ahead will surely be long and winding. So long as we continue to “progress” (and regress!) with technology but do not confront the social roots of its brutal applications, we will produce an abysmal fate for all forms of life." 

<a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/salvaging-the-future/">Javier Sethness Castro</a>, on the other hand, writes much more positively:

"_The Ministry for the Future_ continues Robinson’s critically visionary, optimistic, and reconstructive speculative fiction. In narrative form, he explains why we must change the system, and presents us with a panoply of means—revolutionary and reformist alike. He emphasizes the need for a 'Plan B' to be developed ahead of time, to sustain the revolution, once it breaks out [ . . . ]. _The Ministry for the Future_ depicts a dynamically utopian story of estrangement, self-discovery, and creative struggle to ensure a better future. [ . . . ] At its best, Ministry conveys what could be."

The Annares Project has a very relevant interview with Robinson from February 2021, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-X64HZL6kU&t=2s">YouTube</a>.
