Anthology of 'notable short works of utopian fiction and dystopian fiction,  incorporating elements of primitivism and of eco-anarchism.' (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Primitive:_The_New_Ecotopias">Wikipedia</a>)

Interesting and readable, and unusual for including a worthwhile 5-page  bibliographyâ€”but not especially anarchist.
