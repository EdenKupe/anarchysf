'When it Changed' is included  in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.

_The Female Man_ depicts three parallel versions of the female experience and what it might be, from a radical feminist stance. Whileaway, which is apparently Russ's utopia, is decentralised, and perhaps without government as such, but the verdict of the _Open Road_ critics was that  "The book's feminism is apparently not consistent with an anti-authoritarian structure" (13).

In _We Who Are About To . . ._ a spacecraft crash lands on an unimaginably remote planet where survival will be impossible. The female narrator is the only one who faces reality, while the others fantasize starting anew, with her in the role of Eve. She refuses, and is forced to defend herself from them, leaving her to face her own death alone. There is an excellent extended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200958/https:/ltimmelduchamp.com/node/86">article</a> on this work by L. Timmel Duchamp, from 2005. And in the spring of 2025 this short novel was the subject of a review article in the _Anarchist Review of Books_ #9, by Carrie-Edmund Laben, who notes that "One of the terrors of the current political moment, in the U.S. and everywhere fascism rises, is the terror of being forced into the sort of community that the first part of _We Who Are About To . . ._ portrays."

_The Two of  Them_ was a recommendation made during the panel <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> discussion</a> at the 2009 Seattle Anarchist Bookfair.
