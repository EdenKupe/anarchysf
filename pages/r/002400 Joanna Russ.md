'When it Changed' is included  in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.
 
_The Female Man_ depicts three parallel versions of the female experience and what it might be, from a radical feminist stance. Whileaway, which is apparently Russ's utopia, is decentralised, and perhaps without government as such, but the verdict of the _Open Road_ critics was that  "The book's feminism is apparently not consistent with an anti-authoritarian structure" (13).
  
_The Two of  Them_ was a recommendation made during the panel <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> discussion</a> at the 2009 Seattle Anarchist Bookfair.
