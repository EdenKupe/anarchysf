Rossi was an Italian anarchist who founded a utopian community in Brazil, which only lasted four years. This novel is described by Jose Antonio Vasconcelos, in his 2016 <a href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Giovanni+Rossi+and+his+anarchist+Utopia+in+nineteenth+century+Brazil.-a0503295867">article</a> in _Anarchist 
Studies_, as "an exemplary nineteenth-century Utopia", in which Rossi "ferociously attacks all kinds of authority, those founded on the state, on religion, on property, on personal relations etc."
