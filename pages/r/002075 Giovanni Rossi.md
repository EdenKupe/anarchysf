Rossi was an Italian anarchist who founded a utopian community (La Cec√≠lia) in Brazil, which only lasted four years.

_Un Comune Socialista_ is described by Max Nettlau, in his _Esbozo_, as "the utopia of a village, well written and practical, culminating in anarchist communism, although based at its origin on an act of voluntary benevolence by the owner." Peter Seyferth, in his 2009 'Anarchism and Utopia,' mentions it among a number of less well-known anarchist utopias.

_Il Parana_ is described by Jose Antonio Vasconcelos, in his 2016 <a href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Giovanni+Rossi+and+his+anarchist+Utopia+in+nineteenth+century+Brazil.-a0503295867">article</a> in _Anarchist Studies_, as "an exemplary nineteenth-century Utopia", in which Rossi "ferociously attacks all kinds of authority, those founded on the state, on religion, on property, on personal relations etc."
