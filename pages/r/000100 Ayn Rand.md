Rand was far from being an anarchist  (she once describe anarchy, as a political concept, as "a naive floating  abstraction"), but her immense influence on the libertarian right and the anarcho-capitalists can't be denied. (Rand 1963) Murray Rothbard, a leading influence  on the development of anarcho-capitalism, asserted in his 1973 work _For a New  Liberty_ that "her philosophical influence remains prodigious on the great  bulk of libertarian youth" (15).

_Anthem_ is a dystopia set after a future war, in which the only crime punishable by death is the speaking of the word 'I'; inevitably the hero rebels, and comes to regard the very word as a god. In its exaltation of egoism, and to some extent in its style, it is reminiscent of Stirner's _The Ego and His Own_.  It tied for the 1987 Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award.

_Atlas Shrugged_ is Rand's most influential book, a sustained diatribe against socialism, in which the great industrialists withdraw their 'services' to society as civilisation collapses, with a view to rebuilding capitalism on the ruins.  John Galt, Rand's messiah-figure, makes clear that there is no question of being  opposed to the state as such; he regards police, army, and courts as the "proper  functions of a government" (Signet pb edn: 987), and only opposes government _initiation of force_. It tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1983.
