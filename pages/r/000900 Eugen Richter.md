Surprisingly effective early  dystopia, depicting a diarist's progressive disenchantment with a near-future  socialist state.

Very warmly <a href="https://mises.org/library/pictures-socialistic-future-0">reviewed</a>  on the Mises Institute's website: "This is the book that shouts out, as clearly  as any ever written: we were warned!"
