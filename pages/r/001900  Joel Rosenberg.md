From a 1985 convention report  <a href="http://users.bestweb.net/~jamesl/TarasW1992.html"> online</a>:
 
"Rosenberg said he and Mike McGarry  are writing a novel, in which all the Earth's libertarians are dumped on an  alien planet, and the history of the planet followed for the next 150 years. He  described it as a thought experiment—but then couldn't resist telling us how it  comes out: feudalism. Joel, if you've predetermined the conclusion (I remarked),  it's not an experiment! One might also question the the wisdom of someone who  knows so little about a subject writing a book about it. (Rosenberg was  uncomprehending, even contemptuous of the distinction between the anarchist and  the limited government libertarian. Most if not all of the Founding Fathers were  libertarians in the latter sense.)"

Unless the reference is in fact to Rosenberg's Thousand  Worlds sequence (1984–1990), which according to the <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/rosenberg_joel">Encyclopedia of  Science Fiction</a> features mercantile libertarians, but for which McGarry is  not also credited, it would appear that this novel never appeared, and is now  unlikely to, given Rosenberg's death in 2011.
