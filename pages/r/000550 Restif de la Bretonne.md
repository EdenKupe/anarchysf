Notable work of proto-sf. The title gives the gist, though the later part of the book is utopian in character.
 
This and other works by this author are included in Nettlau's _Esbozo_, in which he describes the utopia as one of socialism. Black (see bibliography) notes that Restif treats of work as almost a game, and games as forms of education.
