Super-advanced aliens, from what is evidently a post-scarcity anarchist society, make contact with a cynical game-developer, with genuinely funny consequences.

Lewis Powell, a contributor to Eric Schwitzgebel's stimulating <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/SF-MasterList-160815-byauthor.pdf">list</a> of Philosophers' Science Fiction / Speculative Fiction Recommendations, 
noting that the novel is much better than you might expect, summarises its interest, saying it "Examines issues in social/political philosophy concerning scarcity of resources (and post-scarcity societies), 
anarchism and social organization, the (dis)value of immortality, and the role of art and games in human life."
