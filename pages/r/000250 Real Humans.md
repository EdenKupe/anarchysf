Excellent TV series about the possible societal implications of humanoid robots (here called 'hubots'): rather like an extended serial episode of _Black Mirror_, with which it was roughly contemporary.

The series was the subject of an article by Mélusine Vertelune in the January 2017 edition of _Le Monde Libertaire_, of which a translation was published in _Fifth Estate_ #398. As a review it's disappointing, as it's little more than a protest against 
the central premise of the series.
