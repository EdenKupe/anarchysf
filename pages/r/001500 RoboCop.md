Set in a near-future crime-ridden Detroit, the  film concerns a police officer who is shot dead by a criminal gang  but subsequently revived by a megacorporation as a superhuman cyborg  law enforcer.

Identified by one contributor to the Anarchism <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/2a2r93/can_we_compile_a_list_of_the_top_films_advocating/"> SubReddit</a> as a film advocating anti-capitalism. Described in _Red Planets_ as a "violent,  anti-corporate satire."

Richard Porton gives a nod to this film in the second edition of <em>Film and the Anarchist Imagination</em>, saying of it that "Verhoeven's speculative fiction proved eerily prophetic inasmuch as it predicts the hyper-militarization of the police and its collusion with the corporate sector."

For <a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-iii-on-the-shores-of-communist-h-e-avens/"> Javier Sethness</a> this film and <em>Sleep Dealer</em> "critique borders, inequality, and labor in a manner consistent with anarchist principles, calling to mind the ongoing importance of class struggle, humanism, cross-border organizing, and migrant solidarity."
