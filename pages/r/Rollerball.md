title: "Norman Jewison - Rollerball"
---

In a megacorporate future the masses are distracted by a brutal gladiatorial  sport played on rollerskates and motorbikes, designed to show up the futility of  individual effort, so keeping the proles in their place. A superstar of the  sport breaks the game by winning against the odds, even when the game has been  fixed to end his career.
  
 Included in the Red Planets  filmography.
