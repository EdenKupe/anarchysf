The Human Ant—written by a French individualist-anarchist—describes the experiences of a man who is magically transformed into an ant, for a year; included in the CIRA catalogue, and referenced at Cohn: 165. It's also the title of a collected translation by Brian Stableford which includes this novel, as well as The Pacifists and a few short tales.

The Pacifists is "the tale of an anti-civilization, pacifist anarchist utopia" (Killjoy, 2009) on an uncharted island. See Granier (in French). Referenced in the 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary. Also see Cohn: 180-1.

Both novels are collected in Brian Stableford's 2014 translation, The Human Ant and Other Stories.

The Superhumans, 'The Ape-Man', and 'The Revolt of the Machines' are all collected in Stableford's 2011 translation, The Superhumans and Other Stories. All are referenced in Cohn. The longest, and most imaginative, is the title story but, as Stableford charitably says in his introduction, "its very extravagance gives it a surreal aspect that insulates the reader from its more discomfiting arguments".
