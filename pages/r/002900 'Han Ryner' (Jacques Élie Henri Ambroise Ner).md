<em>The Human Ant</em>—written by a French individualist-anarchist—describes the experiences of a man who is magically transformed into an ant, for a year; included in the <a href="http://www.cira.ch/catalogue/index.php?lvl=categ_see&id=346&main=">CIRA</a> catalogue, and referenced at Cohn: 165. It's also the title of a collected translation by Brian Stableford which includes this novel, as well as _The Pacifists_ and a few short tales.

_The Pacifists_ is "the tale of an anti-civilization, pacifist anarchist utopia" (Killjoy, 2009) on an uncharted island. See <a href="http://hanryner.over-blog.fr/article-20471578.html">Granier</a> (in French). Referenced in the 2014 _Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary_. Also see Cohn: 180-1.

Both novels are collected in Brian Stableford's 2014 translation, _The Human Ant and Other Stories_.

_The Superhumans_, 'The Ape-Man', and 'The Revolt of the Machines' are all collected in Stableford's 2011 translation, _The Superhumans and Other Stories_. All are referenced in Cohn. The longest, and most imaginative, is the title story but, as Stableford charitably says in his introduction, "its very extravagance gives it a surreal aspect that insulates the reader from its more discomfiting arguments".
