Russell wrote sympathetically of anarchism in his _Roads to Freedom_ (1918), was familiar with its theorists, knew personally Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, worked alongside anarchists in various campaigns, and for decades exercised a libertarian and liberating influence on his contemporaries. Among his less earnest activities was the writing of a small body of fiction, some of which is SF or near-sf. These three stories have some (though only slight) interest to anarchists.
