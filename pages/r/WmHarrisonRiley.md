title: "Wm Harrison Riley - 'A Visitor from Luna'"
---

Short published in Freedom. The lunar visitor is disappointed with Earth, and moves on.
Â 
I have heard of a country in  which the people live naked and unashamed; where there is no hypocrisy, no  usurer, no spirit-dealer, no prison, and where there are no locks or bolts; a  country in which all men and women do their share of the little work that is  needed, where there is no war or usury and all work and share equitably. I am  going to that country, and I hope I may be permitted to live and die there.
Obviously written under the influence of Samuel Butler,  the story has a very considerable charm of its own.
