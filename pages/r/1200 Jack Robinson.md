Among Jack Robinson's many  articles for Freedom and Anarchy are a couple of minor items: '<a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/misc/sp000528.txt">The  Noble Experiment</a>' (Anarchy 1967) is a satirical tale of the prohibition  of the smoking of tobacco in 1993–4; 'After 1984—What?' (Freedom, May  1970, as by Jack Spratt) is a 200-word short-short on the replacement of voting  by opinion polls and the computerisation of parliament. Both are very slight.
