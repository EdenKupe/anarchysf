The _Semiotext(e)_ anthology was reviewed in the <a href="http://www.thesparrowsnest.org.uk/collections/public_archive/PAR0093.pdf">_New Anarchist Review_</a> in July 1990. For 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090321014114/http:/www.nolanchart.com/article5277.html">Dan Clore</a>, in 2008, it is "perhaps the greatest original SF anthology ever published." Rich Dana, in 2014, described this  "wonderful book" as "perhaps the quintessential Anarcho-SF anthology". There's also a paragraph on the work in Tighe's obituary of Peter Lamborn Wilson, in _Fifth Estate_, Fall 2022.
