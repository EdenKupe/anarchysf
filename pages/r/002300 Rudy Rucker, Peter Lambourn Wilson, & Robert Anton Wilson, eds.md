The _Semiotext(e)_ anthology was reviewed in the <a href="http://www.thesparrowsnest.org.uk/collections/public_archive/PAR0093.pdf">_New Anarchist Review_</a> in July 1990. Rich Dana, in 2014, described this  "wonderful book" as "perhaps the quintessential Anarcho-SF anthology". There's also a paragraph on the work in Tighe's obituary of Peter Lamborn Wilson, in _Fifth Estate_, Fall 2022.
