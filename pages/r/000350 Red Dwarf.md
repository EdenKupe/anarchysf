Long-running sf comedy series, widely regarded as the best such since _The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. Described by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2019/08/03/review-the-quanderhorn-xperimentations-by-rob-grant-and-andrew-marshall/">Zeke Teflon</a> as "hands down, the funniest sci-fi comedy series ever produced", the first six series being "gems".
