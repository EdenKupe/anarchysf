_Salt_ features two planetary colonist  communities in ideological conflict, one of which is explicitly anarchistic in  flavour. An intelligent and well-written debut novel. The author himself—a  British academic and historian of sf—says:
 
"I think I'm  on safer ground when I mention the political and ideological issues that the  book rehearses; questions of political affiliation, of the negotiations between  cultural and personal difference, of the relationship to (patriarchal) authority  and of the limits of control. That the book is also a self-conscious exercise in intertextuality is, I hope, equally clear: it draws on Herbert's _Dune_ and on  Ursula Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_ as well as Vladimir Nabokov's _Bend Sinister_ and the poetry of Robert Browning. I hope, in saying this, that I am only saying  what is obvious from the novel itself. It remains the bleakest of my books, but  I continue to find an austere and strangely uplifting beauty in certain aspects  of bleakness, so I say this with no suggestion of apology." <a href="http://www.adamroberts.com/writing/salt/">(author's website)</a>

_Gradisil_ tells of three generations of a family  central to the history of the Uplands, a low Earth orbit settlement  predominantly of the super-rich, from 2059 to 2131. While initially the Uplands  is an anarchy of sorts, it soon becomes a quasi-republic. Farah Mendlesohn, in Callow & McFarlane (see bibliography), notes that the  first part "is a not untypical tale of libertarian colonialism in which rather a  lot of incorrect assumptions about 'how the west was won' are transported into  space," which "is a very twentieth-century interpretation of how western  expansion, or even the founding of America, worked." "The belief that colonial  (and other expansionist) enterprises are the actions of individuals resisting  the state, is a form of institutionalized sociopathy that has infected the  American body politic and the genre of science fiction." She also observes, in  an endnote, that "One political issue I have with most SF, and Roberts's in  particular, is that historically communalist societies are better at surviving." _Gradisil_ is included in the list of 'Stories that explore anarchist  societies' in Killjoy's _Mythmakers  and Lawbreakers_.
 
_New Model Army_ posits a kind of mercenary army, in  a fracturing near-future UK, that dispenses with feudal hierarchy through moment  to moment decision-making by wiki: what is put forward as 'real democracy'. The  work is discussed at length by Thomas Wellman, in Callow & McFarlane, who  concludes that it "invites us to call two visions of modern Europe into question  that have become institutionalized in real-life: the narrative of the peaceful  (and ever closer) union, and the war-inducing concept of the nation-state", and  that it is "far from a simple thought experiment conducted in guerrilla warfare,  but a highly relevant and sceptical treatment of two fundamental principles of  modernity." In the same collection of critical essays, a Borgesian piece by Paul  Graham Raven draws out explicitly the anarchism of the novel, comparing it, as a  utopia, to Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_; he notes that the peer-to-peer  capabilities of the wiki "allow individuals to circumvent state-dominated media  and organize effective collective action against the state, and—possibly, as  Roberts's slingshot ending implies—transcend to a higher order of collectivity:  the paradoxical _post-geographical_ state, an atomised collective to whom  borders are mere fictions, false maps superimposed upon the one, true, free  territory." Andrew M. Butler's essay, immediately following, also notes "the  anarchistic, leaderless structure" of the eponymous NMA.
