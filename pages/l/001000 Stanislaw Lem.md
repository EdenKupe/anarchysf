A poster to the anarchysf mailing list in  2006 considered _Solaris_ to be "insufferably slow, pretentious,  incomprehensible and non-entertaining". Nevertheless, it is included in the  Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/"> reading list</a>.
 
For another poster to anarchysf mailing list  the same year _The Futurological Congress_ "was incredibly fun, fairly easy  to read, deeply insightful, and even having read it more than a decade ago, I  still find my memory of it profoundly enlightening." It's included in the  GoodReads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/10642.Left_wing_Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy?page=1"> Left-wing Science Fiction and Fantasy</a> list.
