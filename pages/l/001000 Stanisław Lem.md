A poster to the anarchysf mailing list in  2006 considered _Solaris_ to be "insufferably slow, pretentious,  incomprehensible and non-entertaining". Nevertheless, it is included in the  Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/"> reading list</a>.

_Memoirs Found in a Bathtub_ is referred to by David Graeber in his 2012 'Dead Souls of the Imagination' as "pretty much straight Kafka."

_His Master's Voice_ is referenced in Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations_.

For another poster to anarchysf mailing list  in 2006  _The Futurological Congress_ "was incredibly fun, fairly easy  to read, deeply insightful, and even having read it more than a decade ago, I  still find my memory of it profoundly enlightening." It's included in the  GoodReads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/10642.Left_wing_Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy?page=1"> Left-wing Science Fiction and Fantasy</a> list.
