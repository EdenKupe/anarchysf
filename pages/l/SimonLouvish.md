"A political thriller set in a parallel universe in which the libertarian Marxist Rosa Luxemburg has led a successful communist revolution." (Dan Clore)  There are in fact numerous other major divergences, dating back at least as far  as Napoleon. There are also a number of explicit anarchist references, including  one in which a character speculates about the possibility of alternate  universes, one much like our own, but another in which Bakunin succeeded in  having Marx expelled from the First International.
