First volume of a remarkable breakout Chinese trilogy. Killjoy commented on it on the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum in 2017: "It's definitely not a ringing endorsement of communist china. (nor is it a hamfisted dystopian critique of it.)", and overall "I loved it". . . .

Of the second volume, _The Dark Forest_ (黑暗森林, 2008; English translation by Joel Martinsen, 2015), Jesse Cohn wrote in his 2024 _Hot Equations_ "The projection of Henry Kissinger's realpolitik onto the entire universe of possible forms of life is a breathtaking act of speculation represented as prudence. Perhaps it is really only Hobbes' _Leviathan_ writ even larger, only this time representing an interstellar 'state of nature' to the rescue of which no supra-universal Sovereign will come." (87-88)
