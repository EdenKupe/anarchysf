title: "C.S. Lewis - Out of the Silent Planet  (1938); That Hideous Strength"
---

Out of the Silent Planet is the first part in  Lewis's theological space trilogy. For <a href="http://thelibertarianliquidationist.com/2014/06/10/anarchy-by-c-s-lewis-pt-2/"> Justin Fowler</a> there are "hints of a subtle anarchist philosophy threaded  throughout", and the novel is "a simply delicious work of literature that  libertarians may treasure forever."
Â 
That Hideous Strength is the final  part. It is included  in Monsen's <a href="http://www.andersmonsen.com/50-works-of-fiction-libertarians-should-read/"> 50 works of fiction libertarians should read</a>, and in Goodreads' <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/libertarian-science-fiction"> Popular libertarian science fiction books</a>.
