The  first solarpunk anthology, published in Brazil. Described by the publisher as a collection of  optimistic science fiction stories which envision a world run on renewable  energies. Quite a diverse collection, with none of the authors known to me, but  overall—despite its good intentions—rather disappointing.

One story—'Once Upon a Time in a World,' by Antonio Luiz  M.C. Costa—includes a character named 'George Orwell', who strongly  self-identifies as an anarchist.
