Lieffe comes to SF with an unusual and rather refreshing perspective. _Margins and Murmurations_ (the first in a trilogy, each book of which is readable as a standalone novel) presents a not-too-distant future dystopia in which the LGBTQ+ community, sex workers, and disabled people are centre stage in the Resistance. _Conserve and Control_ is set in the same future, but further ahead (a hundred years from the publication date), and, in the author's words, the second book "looks superficially like a liberal utopia – all permaculture gardens and trans-inclusive corporations – but is very much the most sinister world I could find the power to write in 2018." _Dignity_ is at a nearer stage in the same future, when the pandemic of the 2020s is still within living memory; Lieffe says her intention was for _Dignity_ to be "the most utopic writing I could find within myself."

_Anarchist Studies_ published an extended <a href="https://anarchiststudies.noblogs.org/article-survival-is-an-act-of-resistance-an-interview-with-kes-otter-lieffe/?fbclid=IwAR0WJP22h59ArGZsn99-zhODi9azhzA7r3fOlxIqqAVVMT0ppHAdTPPLLUM">interview</a> with the author in January 2021. The extent to which her work can be described as anarchist is explicitly discussed; rather evading the word, she replied "I mean, if book shops create a ‘radical, sex work positive, trans feminist, speculative fiction’ genre section just for my work, I’m okay with that." However, the discussion makes it clear that her intention was to present visions of a revolution that people could relate to:

"The revolution is absolutely made up of people and their contributions and their agency. It’s a lot of meetings and processing dynamics and drinking tea around a fire trying to figure out how to care for each other and meet our material needs. Every time we solve our conflicts without calling the cops, we are living a part of prison abolition. Every time we find ways to care for each other and hold on to each other in a culture centred on disposability, we are growing the revolution. In that sense, I think the revolution is the central story here and not the context."
