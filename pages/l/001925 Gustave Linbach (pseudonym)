An upper-class Anglo-Indian actively promotes anarchist terrorism, in the belief that once 'anarchy' prevails there will inevitably be the need for a supreme ruler, and he himself will step in as Dictator of the British Empire. His monomania extends to actively encouraging a cholera epidemic in England, but of course he meets his comeuppance.
