"An anthology of (mostly original) libertarian capitalist short stories." (Dan Clore) Better than it sounds; in particular Victor Koman's  'Demokratus' is an  enjoyably retro take on democracy extended ad absurdum. The anthology won a  Special Award from the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1998.
