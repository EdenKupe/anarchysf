'The Call of Cthulhu' was mentioned by David Graeber in an endnote to his 2015 _The Utopia of Rules_.

'The Mound' is included in Dan Clore's 2001 <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.arts.sf.written/c/9YkCKLGAFyo">Anarchist & Libertarian Socialist Societies in Utopian & Science Fiction</a>, in which he notes that "the mound-dwellers have a decadent, 'semi-anarchical' society."
