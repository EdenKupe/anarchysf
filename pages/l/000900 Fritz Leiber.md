For Moorcock, writing in 1978,  "Fritz Leiber is probably the best of all the American SF writers for his prose-style,  his wit and his humanity, as well as his abiding contempt for authoritarianism,  and _Gather, Darkness_ is one of the best SF books to relate political  power to religious power" . . . .

The book concerns an underground witch conspiracy against establishment theocracy, all founded on scientific gadgetry. Though commendably irreligious, it is lightweight.
