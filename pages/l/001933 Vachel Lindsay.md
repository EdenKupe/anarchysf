A lyrical imagining of life in a future 2018 in the author's home town of Springfield, Illinois. It's usually classed as utopian, but it isn't really a conventional utopia. Its present <a href="https://charleshkerr.com/books/the-golden-book-of-springfield-by-vachel-lindsay">publisher</a> describes it as "radically nonconformist", and speaks of the author's affinities with anarchism. This is only questionably visible in the novel, in which there is a world government, and a war with Singapore; shockingly, there are instances of lynchings (though apparently more politically motivated than racist), which though not supported by the narrator are treated as unexceptional.
