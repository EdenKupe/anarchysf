Dystopian vision of a world in which all men have died, and the women survivors resort to desperate measures to get their calories. In a literal sense it reads more as the narration of a nightmare, than a work of science fiction.

Extravagantly praised in an adulatory ("tremendous", "deliciously weird and brutal") review by Lara Messersmith-Glavin <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/the-horror-of-imagination-a-review-of-ration-apex-2019-by-cody-t-luff/">_Anarchist Studies_</a>.
