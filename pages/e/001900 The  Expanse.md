 More recently (2021) the article <a href="https://cstonline.net/anarchism-is-the-expanse-by-chris-nunn/">Anarchism is the Expanse by Chris Nunn</a> gives a well-informed analysis of how the apparent association with anarchism develops during the course of the series, including the evolution of its use of the symbol. Nunn concludes that "It is possible to conclude that the writers and producers of _The Expanse_ were reflecting real historical situations by incorporating the anarchist symbol into The OPA flag in the early seasons of the show. After all, the various factions of Belters seeking liberation from oppression, coupled with the frequent disagreements among them as to appropriate tactics, represent a very real analogy to many anarchist struggles (even some which continue today). However, the reappearance of this symbol during the events of season five is a less critical inclusion, making the mistake that multiple other film and television texts have over the years and making anarchism synonymous with acts of terror."
