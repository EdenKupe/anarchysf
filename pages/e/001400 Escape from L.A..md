A near future Los Angeles has been separated from the  mainland by an earthquake, and is now being used as an internment camp and  general people dump for anyone in the US deemed morally unfit. A criminal is  tasked with a race against time, to retrieve a superweapon and the President's  runaway daughter. Vaguely comedic, but mostly just silly.

Libertarian co-producer and co-writer Kurt Russell  "manages to get some libertarian points across," according to <a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/E/Escape-From-LA-1996-.html">Libertarian  Movies</a>, which notes that "Snake, the cynical antihero, rejects both the  right-wing government that enforces 'moral crimes' and the left-wing resistance  which aims to use force to achieve its anti-technology goals." Osborne's guide (see bibliography) says "It's not a bad flick on  its own merits and it has an underlying message libertarians will appreciate."
