The CEO of an Internet giant calls one of his  programmers to his isolated home and research base, where he is  asked to appraise the level of consciousness of his most recent  android construct, whom its creator already believes to have passed  the Turing test. The experiment proves all too successful, the  android outwitting both of them, and escaping her confinement. An  intelligent and beautifully made film, clearly echoing the  Frankenstein motif.
