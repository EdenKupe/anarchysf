Primarily a romantic fiction centred on an  anarchist-hunter and an anarchist, the latter ultimately plotting to destroy  society by means of anthrax germs distributed by balloon; she only succeeds in  killing herself. Although the author displays considerable knowledge of 1890s  anarchism, the image he paints of anarchists is only lurid and melodramatic: one  instance will suffice, in which an anarchist, who has been betraying the  conspiracy unwittingly via his wife, redeems himself by slitting her throat and  writing 'Vive l'Anarchie' on the wall in her blood.
