Dogs are metamorphosing into women, and women into sundry  animals. The central character, Pooch, aspires to being an opera singer.

Seen by Mark Bould in _Red  Planets_ (see bibliography) as "challenging masculinist reason and rationality." Included in the <a href="https://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-title/">Think Galactic</a>  reading list.
