title: "Alex Garland - Ex Machina"
---

The CEO of an Internet giant calls one of his  programmers to his isolated home and research base, where he is  asked to appraise the level of consciousness of his most recent  android construct, whom its creator already believes to have passed  the Turing test. The experiment proves all too successful, the  android outwitting both of them, and escaping her confinement. An  intelligent and beautifully made film, clearly echoing the  Frankenstein motif.

Micheline</a>, a view endorsed by Eoin O'Connor on the Facebook  Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum. Also noted on the FB Solarpunk  Anarchists and Anarchists & Science Fiction pages. Two contributors  to the FB Forum include this film among their shortlists of the best  SF ever committed to film.
