Summarised by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/tag/anarchist-science-fiction/">Teflon</a> as follows: "Not anarchist, and only implicitly antiauthoritarian, <em>American War</em> is almost certainly the best fictional depiction of the psychological and physical devastation caused by America's interventionist wars, and the hatred and terrorism they engender."
