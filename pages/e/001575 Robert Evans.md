Readable but militaristic view of North America in 2070, after a civil war has led to the disunion of the States. Occasional hints of anarchist influence come across as tokenistic. 

Unusually, it is the subject of a long review by Dan Baker, a serving political prisoner, at <a href="https://www.abcf.net/">ABCF</a>, the Anarchist Black Cross Federation website. Baker considers it the best novel he's read since going to prison. He comments that "Being a combat veteran I am deeply moved by this book. More importantly than the realistic descriptions of humanity's violence is the prophetic prediction of the life cycle of the United States government."

The novel is recommended by <a href="https://electricliterature.com/a-literary-guide-to-antifascism/">Shane Burley</a>, for whom it is "an epic speculative fiction story that feels eerily close to our everyday reality. Exploring the aftermath of the United States' collapse in the year 2070, Evans demonstrates that the coming crisis is one where the far-right will manipulate the population's desire for stability, making antifascism essential for those hoping to replace our decaying society with something more humane."
