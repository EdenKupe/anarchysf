Multiply-derivative and pointless dystopian yarn, so corny  it's boring.

One comment, on Reason.com's <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2004/03/05/the-libertarian-film-festival#comment"> The Libertarian Film Festival</a>, describes it as "The fight against total  state control. A great terrible movie." Sorry, but it's just terrible.
