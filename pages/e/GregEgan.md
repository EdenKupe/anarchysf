title: "Greg Egan - Permutation City (1994); Distress"
---

Permutation City is  among books cited by Nick Mamatas in The BASTARD Chronicles 2015 as hard  SF overwhelmed by religious allegory.
 
Distress is largely  set against the backdrop of the sympathetically presented anarcho-syndicalist society  of Stateless, an engineered coral island in the Pacific. The inhabitants mostly disregard anarchist thinkers like Bakunin, Proudhon and Godwin; children are  educated in sociobiology.
 
. . .  Stateless seemed to run on the principle of people agreeing to do the same thing  for entirely different reasons. It was a sum over mutually contradictory  topologies which left the calculus of pre-space for dead; no imposed politics,  philosophy, religion, no idiot cheer-squad worship of flags or symbols—but  order emerged nevertheless. (ch. 24)
