In a future North America where the nation state has all but withered away, and though corporations still hold sway much of society is now organised around the maintenance of river watersheds, an alien spacecraft 
lands and first contact is made with an ordinary woman from one of the watersheds. The story follows through to a hopeful conclusion of co-operation between humans and aliens.
