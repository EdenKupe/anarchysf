Similar to, and better than, _Escape from L.A._, with  the penal colony being the whole island of Manhattan, and the hostage the  President himself.

For <a href="http://liberty4eva.blogspot.co.uk/">liberty4eva</a>, Snake "would definitely be considered a libertarian anarchist  if one had to guess his political leanings upon watching Escape From New York as  well as the inferior 90's sequel Escape From L.A."
