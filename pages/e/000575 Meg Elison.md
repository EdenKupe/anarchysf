_Big Girl plus_ is another of the excellent PM Press Outspoken Authors series. Unusually, this little book has been reviewed twice over in _Fifth Estate_. The first review (#408, Winter 2021), by Stacy Flynn, described the collection as "gorgeously surreal", and focuses most on the title story and the Nebula-nominated 'The Pill'. Flynn says "The verve and inventiveness of Elison's stories temper what could otherwise be a heavy-handed social critique, though it's when she savages the dominant culture, that the work is at its best." Jess Flarity's review (#410, Fall 2021) is also fulsome, highlighting the dystopian 'Such People' as well as 'The Pill', noting of the latter that "I can't remember the last time I laughed and cringed so hard at the same time."

Flynn also refers to Elison's award-winning debut novel, _The Book of the Unnamed Midwife_.
