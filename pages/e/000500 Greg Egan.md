<em>Permutation City</em> is  among books cited by Nick Mamatas in <em>The BASTARD Chronicles 2015</em> as hard  SF overwhelmed by religious allegory.
 
<em>Distress</em> is largely  set against the backdrop of the sympathetically presented anarcho-syndicalist society  of Stateless, an engineered coral island in the Pacific. The inhabitants mostly disregard anarchist thinkers like Bakunin, Proudhon and Godwin; children are  educated in sociobiology.
 
. . .  "Stateless seemed to run on the principle of people agreeing to do the same thing  for entirely different reasons. It was a sum over mutually contradictory  topologies which left the calculus of pre-space for dead; no imposed politics,  philosophy, religion, no idiot cheer-squad worship of flags or symbols—but  order emerged nevertheless." (ch. 24)

<em>Diaspora</em> is a cerebral far-future novel, which has proved of interest to some anarchists. One comment on Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/4vopai/interesting_anarchist_fiction/">Interesting Anarchist Fiction?</a> page doubted whether it can be explicitly classified as anarchist, but "it provides an interesting exploration of how an Anarcho-Transhumanist society could function." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/b39zlx/anarchysf_an_opensource_repository_of_anarchist/">Eden Kupermintz</a>, too, also found it "a really interesting take on post-humanism and AI." A comment <a href="https://www.tor.com/2019/10/22/science-fictional-rulers-from-undying-emperors-to-starlike-sovereigns/">elsewhere</a> pointed to its "anarchist and extremely consensus-based, consent-required governance".
