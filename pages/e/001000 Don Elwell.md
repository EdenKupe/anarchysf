Recommended by Melanie Petrewski, who says:

"It's kind of a different  take, postulating a "floating republic" kind of syndicalist gathering based on  17th century ships articles. Â I found it interesting because it seemed vaguely  plausible as well as the fact that it completely avoided the sort of  philosophical overthink in most Anarchist depictions."
