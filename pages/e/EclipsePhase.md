Well-received role  playing game, described by SFE as being set in "a complexly inhabited solar system after the Fall, a war  against rogue AIs which ended only when the enemy escaped to the stars, taking  with them millions of forcibly uploaded human minds. Earth is a deadly  wasteland, surrendered to roving packs of self improving war machines. The  survivors of the Fall exist in colonies scattered throughout the system, where  they have created new economies based on nanotechnology and new societies  ranging from corporate semi-democracies to anarchist cooperatives and  libertarian associations."
 
Reviewed by Margaret  Killjoy for the  Anarcho-Geek Review, in July 2017, who summed it up as "a damn good game",  while wishing that "I could play a strategy game that actually reflected the ways I think  tactically, economically, and socially. You’re always stuck being a space  tyrant."
 
In October 2017  Freedom published a long and interesting interview with Rob Boyle, co-creator of the game, in  anticipation of the launch of its second edition. Boyle explicitly acknowledges  his anarchist background and influences:
 
I first identified as an anarcho-communist back  in high school in the 1980s, and through the ’90s and beyond I was heavily  involved with anarchist publishing and organising projects. EP co-creator Brian  Cross also identifies as an anarchist, and he has a background as a sociology  professor. We obviously injected a lot of our outlook.
If I had to highlight my specific influences I  would say Murray Bookchin, for his approaches towards confederalism, technology,  and social ecology, and probably the entire German autonomist/antifa movement,  for its non-dogmatic approach to synthesising radical ideas. Anarchist science  writer Brian Martin probably impacted some of my views on scientific  responsibility.

Overall, politically, I think my ideas have been  strongly shaped by the Sojourner Truth Organisation, active in the ’70s-80s, who  have had a larger impact than I think most modern anarchists realise.
Asked about the forthcoming second edition, Boyle says  that "We have received some criticism that our depiction of autonomist space is  sometimes “too utopian,” so in the future we’ll be focusing a bit more on some  of the problems that might arise within a transhuman anarchist society, which is  I think a good exercise for us as radicals."
