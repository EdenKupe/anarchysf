Readable but militaristic view of North America in 2070, after a civil war has led to the disunion of the States. Occasional hints of anarchist influence come across as tokenistic.

Unusually, it is the subject of a long review by Dan Baker, a serving political prisoner, at <a href="https://www.abcf.net/">ABCF</a>, the Anarchist Black Cross Federation website. Baker considers it the best novel he's read since going to prison. He comments that "Being a combat veteran I am deeply moved by this book. More importantly than the realistic descriptions of humanity's violence is the prophetic prediction of the life cycle of the United States government."
