title: "Malka Older - Infomocracy"
---

Debut novel with a promising premise of potential  interest: in an internet-dominated world, nation states have fragmented, and the  primary political units are now the 'centenals', micro-states with a population  of just 100,000-odd. Teflon's <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/review-infomocracy-by-malka-older/"> See Sharp Press review</a> is spot on in identifying the book's strengths and  weaknesses, of which the latter outweigh the former. Given the premise, the  dearth of information on how the centenals operate, internally, or how the  system came about, or the political differences between the various factions  fighting a global election, is significant. For Teflon the promise—despite the  quality of the writing in other respects—remains unfulfilled.
