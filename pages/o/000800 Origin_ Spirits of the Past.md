Global civilisation has collapsed, following a failed  attempt at geo-engineering, which covers the world in sentient trees.  Individuals brought forward from the past seek to reverse the process, but  eventually realise the future is to live in harmony with the mutant trees.
 
Connor Owens, at <a href="https://solarpunkanarchists.com/2016/02/19/eco-anime-six-movies-with-ecological-themes-tropes-and-messages/#more-31">solarpunkanarchists.com</a>,  notes that "The finger is pointed more at militarism and statism as being  responsible for environmental devastation more than some kind innate  species-wide propensity towards wrecking the Earth." Though finding the film  "excessively preachy and unsubtle", he concludes that "Origin succeeds in coming  close to what's called the social ecology school of environmental thought,  emphasising human-nature cooperation and balance between the two as a solution  to conflict, rather than one dominating or destroying the other."
