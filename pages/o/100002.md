Debut novel with a promising premise of potential interest: in an internet-dominated world, nation states have fragmented, and the primary political units are now the 'centenals', micro-states with a population of just 100,000-odd. Teflon'sSee Sharp Press review is spot on in identifying the book's strengths and weaknesses, of which the latter outweigh the former. Given the premise, the dearth of information on how the centenals operate, internally, or how the system came about, or the political differences between the various factions fighting a global election, is significant. For Teflon the promise—despite the quality of the writing in other respects—remains unfulfilled.
