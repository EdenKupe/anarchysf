Well-intentioned but heavy-handed satire intended to call attention to the global climate crisis. The subject of much discussion on the Facebook Anarchist Film Group in December 2021: mixed opinions, but mostly negative.

The film was reviewed by William R. Boyer in the Spring 2022 edition of _Fifth Estate_ (#411). Boyer notes that "The film's ambitious targets: climate change denial, corporate capitalism, vacuous leadership, contemporary consumption, superstition over science, lunatic conspiracy theories and the failures of both mass media and social media, consider the grim possibility of the planet&#39;s not-so-distant extinction in terms of technology run amok. The message works for the most part, even if the medium cannot reconcile its own internal contradictions [ . . .]". For the reviewer, it invokes comparisons with _Dr Strangelove_ and _Brazil_.
