Klaatu, a human-like alien, with an eight-foot  tall robot, comes to Earth to notify humanity that "It is no concern  of ours how you run your own planet, but if you threaten to extend  your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out  cinder. Your choice is simple: join us, and live in peace, or pursue  your present course and face obliteration."

Alex Peak has an essay on the film's <a href="http://alexpeak.com/art/films/tdtess/libertarian/"> Libertarian Themes</a>. He argues that, by his actions, Klaatu is  not "in perfect harmony with libertarian ethics", and "Since the  anarchist recognises that all true hierarchies are maintained only  through aggression, and since the anarchist wishes to eliminate  aggression and thus also all true hierarchies, we can conclude  objectively that Klaatu is not an anarchist, despite whatever  libertarian tendencies swell within his own society.Â Therefore,  _if_ Klaatu is a libertarian at all, he is at most a minarchist."  He concludes that, despite this, "The movie may be regarded as  libertarian due to its subtle yet persistent rejection of  xenophobia, its warnings against substituting fear for reason, its  examination of the dangers of nuclear war and nuclear weapons  generally, and its insistence that there is something socially  problematic about any hypermilitaristic society."

_Red  Planets_ (see bibliography) lists the film, but is somewhat dismissive:  "Anti-nuclear film (or a celebration of the pax Americana)."
