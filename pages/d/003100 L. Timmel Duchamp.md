Included in  Killjoy's list (see bibliography) of stories that explore anarchist societies. Also recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel 'Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction' at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009.

In the strongly feminist _Alanya to Alanya_  Earth women, including some anarchists, are actively supported by the Marq'ssan  aliens, who, with technological superiority on their side, vigorously promote  "non-authoritarian self-governance". _Blood in the Fruit_  includes a sequence in which the North West Free Zone celebrates Emma Goldman  Day; three Goldman quotations serve as epigraph to the novel, and the front  cover features a photograph of Goldman speaking in Union Square, at Duchamp's  own suggestion—she has said that "Most of the Free Zone activists are  working-class women who embrace a philosophy of life and politics very close to  Goldman's . . .".

"SM: So anarchism, or negotiation, is possible not  only on a small scale but also a large scale?

"LTD: Yes, I believe it is. But it would require  major changes in our educational system, in the distribution of information, and  in how we live as active, responsible subjects in the world. It would require,  in short, that as a species, we mature and leave childhood behind (i.e., that we  metaphorically speaking develop the part of our pre-frontal cortex that is able  to see past the moment and think beyond impulse, as the medical literature tells  us happens when individuals mature into adults)."

_The Marq'ssan Cycle_ as a whole is a significant  work, looking at relationships of power at many levels, especially the  interpersonal. Duchamp has said:

"I wanted this to be a story charting an on-going process  of change, not one in which a tabula-rasa utopia is created in the wake of an  apocalypse allowing everyone to "start over" without significant institutional  baggage. In the course of writing the first novel, I soon realized that getting  rid of a repressive regime is the easy part. The characters in these books are  as resistant to changing ingrained patterns of political and social behavior as  any living person is. Which is why the series spans two decades and comprises  five long novels."
