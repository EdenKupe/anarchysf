Created by Estonian studio Zaum, this is a dialogue-heavy video game set in a fictional world.
The game features a city recovering from a failed communist revolution that was undermined by incompetence but also thwarted by foreign invaders. 
It presents a critical and comical depiction of several ideologies, including Communism, Liberalism, Centrism and Fascism.

The city depicted is managed in a rather anarchist way, with government involvement being minor, and most things in the town being run by the union or by individuals.

The main character is a detective, and the game is relatively uncritical of police, although it does present a more anarchist take on police.

The sci-fi elements are rather subdued, with technology working differently in this world than in ours, but not being way more advanced.
