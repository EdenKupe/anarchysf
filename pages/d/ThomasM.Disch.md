title: "Thomas M. Disch - Camp Concentration (1968); 'Mutability'"
---

Vittorio Curtoni, writing in 1978, considered Camp  Concentration to be "very fine". It concerns the experimental  treatment of American concentration-camp inmates with a syphilis-derived drug  which enhances intelligence but accelerates death. In 2019 [anarchistnews.org published a podcast centred on the novel](https://www.anarchistnews.org/content/frr-books-podcast-camp-concentration-thomas-disch).
 
'Mutability' is set in the free university city of Tübingen at the end of the 21st century. Tübingen is said to have been declared a free city by the UN in  2039, after the faculty and students of the university had spearheaded the pan-Germanic Anarchist movement. It is said to have a uniquely democratic government, but American observers seem to be unimpressed.
