title: "Irving Pichel - Destination Moon"
---

Historically important as the first serious attempt at portraying a mission to  the moon, a major difference from what eventually happened in the 1960s being  that in the film it was private enterprise that ran the show. Loosely based on Rocketship Galileo, by Robert Heinlein, who acted as technical advisor to  the film
 Â 
 In 2007 an article copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list, on the occasion of the  centenary of Heinlein's birth, described this as "the first sober space travel  movie".
