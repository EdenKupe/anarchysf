 A Strange Manuscript is a lost-race story, set in Antarctica. In 1969  George Woodcock discussed the work as a "solitary successful Canadian utopian  novel" (97), deciding that it is not so much utopia as Butlerian satire: its  moral vision, "perhaps . . . characteristic of Canada", he finds to be "that of  the Middle way—moderation in all things." (98) In 1980 he found the novel "an  effective satire on the hypocritical Victorian world" de Mille lived in  (Woodcock 1980: 24).
