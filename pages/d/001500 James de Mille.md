_A Strange Manuscript_ is a lost-race story, set in Antarctica. In 1969  George Woodcock discussed the work as a "solitary successful Canadian utopian  novel" (97), deciding that it is not so much utopia as Butlerian satire: its  moral vision, "perhaps . . . characteristic of Canada", he finds to be "that of  the Middle wayâ€”moderation in all things." (98) In 1980 he found the novel "an  effective satire on the hypocritical Victorian world" de Mille lived in  (Woodcock 1980: 24).
