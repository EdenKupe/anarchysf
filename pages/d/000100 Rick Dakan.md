Dakan is described by Killjoy (see bibliography), in one of his featured interviews, as an 'anarchist geek'. This  entertaining caper story was taken as 'certainly' science fiction by a  contributor to the Anarchysf mailing list, but can't really be seen as SF at  all, though it's still likely to be of interest to SF readers.
