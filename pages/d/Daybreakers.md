Ten years hence a vampire corporation captures and farms the  remaining mortal humans while developing a substitute for human  blood. A vampire hematologist's work is interrupted by human  survivors led by a former vampire who has discovered a cure for  vampirism. The SF context is well developed, so it's not just  another vampire movie.
