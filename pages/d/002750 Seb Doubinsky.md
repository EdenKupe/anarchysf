A former radical hacker struggles with memory and identity as a user of a new DNA-based drug that generates context-based hallucinations like a hyper-real augmented reality.

Doubinsky identifies as an anarchist, and is himself the grandson of a Russian anarchist. Exceptionally, he has expressly shown his support for the <a href="anarchysf.com">anarchySF</a> website. There is a good 
interview with him at <a href="https://cosmicomicon.blogspot.com/2017/03/tc-review-interview-author-poet-and.html">Cosmicomicon</a>, and in his blog <a href="https://sebdoubinsky.blogspot.com/2015/06/anarchism-and-utopia_96.html">archive</a> he says, in rebuttal to claims that anarchism is utopian, that "anarchism does not seem more utopian to me than a world living in peace thanks to non-regulated markets, than a harmonious society where the rich get richer and the poor are happy to get poorer, and where a handful of privileged politicians, bankers and businessmen decide of the fate of entire countries, which were ruined by them ... As far as utopias are concerned, I'm sorry to say, but I much prefer mine." In 2024 his <a href="https://sebdoubinsky.blogspot.com/">blog</a> set out what is in effect his political manifesto for change.
