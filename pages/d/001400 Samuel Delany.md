_Babel-17_, 'Aye and Gomorrah',  and _The Einstein Intersection_ are included in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.  Babel-17 is quoted in _The BASTARD Chronicles 2015_, and is briefly but warmly reviewed by Kupermintz at the end of one of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Dishonored--not-Resentful-e13m25a">anarchySF</a> podcasts.

_Dhalgren_ has been described as  presenting a world which is 'anarchist in all but name' (Moore 95).  Although this is questionable, this is a stimulating and thought-provoking novel  that bears inclusion here.

_Trouble on Triton_ was recommended by  <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel "Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction" at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009. Delany has said  that the novel was written partly in dialogue with Ursula Le Guin's _The  Dispossessed_, his ambiguous heterotopia a response to her ambiguous utopia.  His own perspective is that SF can't really be utopian. More pretentious  than _Dhalgren_, _Trouble on Triton_ hasn't aged as well. The  interview with Delany published in 1990 as <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/delany52interview.htm">"On Triton and Other Matters"</a> is actually more interesting than the  novel.

_Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of  Sand_ is discussed and quoted in _The BASTARD Chronicles 2015_, and has been recommended by a contributor to the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>. Another, on <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/256904/No-More-Culture-Books-left-what-other-SF-is-like-Iain-Banks"> Ask Metafilter</a>, considered that "I don't think that Delany describes the  society of Morgre as anarchist, but it definitely has anarchist-style social  organization." In fact he almost does: he describes the most common form of  government on Velm (the planet) as "an efficient bureaucratic anarchy". Later he  says that of the 6000 worlds only 30% have a world government, but in the same  paragraph describes Velm's bureaucratic anarchy as a world government. It  isn't really an anarchy in anarchist terms: his definition says that  "Bureaucratic anarchy means a socialist world government in which small sections  are always reverting to some form of feudal capitalism for anywhere from a week  to two years standard—the longest we'll allow it to last."
