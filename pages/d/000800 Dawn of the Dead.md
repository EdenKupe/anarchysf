Gory zombie film. <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/dawn_of_the_dead"><i> SFE</i></a> insists it is true sf, as Romero is interested in  zombies the way an SF writer might be interested in aliens.

Wendy McElroy, at <a href="http://dailyanarchist.com/2013/01/21/political-message-of-the-rising-zombie/"> Daily Anarchist.com</a>, says "This is his most explicit assault on  mindless, modern consumerism. [. . . ] In short, the walking dead  are doing the same thing as they did as the walking living. This  glimpse of voracious humanity is all the more horrifying because it  contains truth."
