As an unhinged USAF general orders a first strike nuclear  attack on the Soviet Union, the US President, with other heads of state and  forces top brass, tries to recall the bombers to prevent World War III, while  the crew of one B-52 bomber try to deliver their payload. In the words of the <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/dr_strangelove">SFE</a>,  "grotesquely satirical and very funny".

For <a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/D/Dr-Strangelove-1964-.html">Libertarian  Movies</a> it's "Not only one of the greatest anti-war films ever, but easily  the funniest!"

Jakob Larrew at <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/covid-19-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-virus-by-jakob-larrew/">Anarchist Studies</a> wrote in 2020 that "The movie is a seething satirical critique of the mystification of American society: from the blind belief in American propaganda to the point of fanaticism, to the governmentâ€™s incompetency and its willingness to follow its ideology to the point of fascism and the death of the human race."
