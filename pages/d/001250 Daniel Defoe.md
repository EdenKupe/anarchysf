The novel, as <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/defoe_daniel">SFE</a> puts it, "while not sf, provided a fundamental model for many sf stories". Described by Marie-Louise Berneri as "a one-man utopia", the work is also referenced for its influence in Nettlau's <em>Esbozo</em> (see bibliography for Berneri and Nettlau).
