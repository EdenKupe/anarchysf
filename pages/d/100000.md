Dakan is described by <a href="Mythmakers%20&amp;%20Lawbreakers.%20Anarchist%20writers%20on%20fiction"> Killjoy</a>, in one of his featured interviews, as an 'anarchist geek'. This  entertaining caper story was taken as 'certainly' science fiction by a  contributor to the Anarchysf mailing list, but can't really be seen as sf at  all, though it's still likely to be of interest to sf readers.
