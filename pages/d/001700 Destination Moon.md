Historically important as the first serious attempt at portraying a mission to  the moon, a major difference from what eventually happened in the 1960s being  that in the film it was private enterprise that ran the show. Loosely based on _Rocketship Galileo_, by Robert Heinlein, who acted as technical advisor to  the film

In 2007 an article copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list, on the occasion of the  centenary of Heinlein's birth, described this as "the first sober space travel  movie".
