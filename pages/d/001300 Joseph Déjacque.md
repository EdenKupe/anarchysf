"A walk-through description of the world in the year 2858, after the abolition of the state, religion, property, and the family." (Dan Clore) Described by Kropotkin himself as an anarchist-communist utopia, and by Max Nettlau as "L'utopie anarchiste par excellence". Editor of the New York anarchist paper _Le Libertaire_, he "let his utopian imagination run riot" in _L'Humanisphère_. "Each is his own representative in a 'parliament of anarchy'. Déjacque's 'humanispheres' resemble Fourier's 'phalansteries' and while based on the principle of complete freedom reflect a similarly rigid planning." (Peter Marshall:435) For George Woodcock Déjacque's vision was "Fourier modified by his opposite, Proudhon." He also felt that it "in some remarkable ways anticipates the vision of the future which H.G. Wells projected in _Men Like Gods_." (Woodcock [1975]: ch. 10)

_L'Humanisphère_ was first serialised in _Le Libertaire_, the US's first anarcho-communist journal, of which Déjacque was editor. (Killjoy, 2009) Déjacque is said to have exercised an influence on the anarchist movement in Latin America through the intermediary figure of journalist Sebastian Faure.

In the Fall 2022 issue of _Fifth Estate_ John Clark promoted a Déjacque Bicentennial Conference, in an article entitled 'The Anarchist Almost No One Knows'. Clark considers that "Déjacque deserves much greater attention than he has received, and much greater recognition of his significance in the history of anarchism and utopianism."

In 2016 sf author Brian Stableford published an English translation of almost half the book—the section entitled 'Le monde future'—as one of four works by French writers in his collection _The Humanisphere_. In his introduction he notes that "From a literary viewpoint, the narrative of the futuristic vision is relatively uninteresting, containing no characters, no dialogue and little concrete description of the anarchist way of life, but it does contain some plangent rhetoric, and a concise summary of the anarchist ideal that is particularly interesting in comparison to other accounts of the role of science and technology in hypothetical societies. ( . . . ) In Déjacque's vision, Anarchism and advanced technology are intimately interlinked, and his thesis is, in a sense, the ultimate extrapolation of the eighteenth-century philosophy that saw technological and social progress as different aspects of the same process."
