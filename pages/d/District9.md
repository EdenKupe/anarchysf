title: "Neill Blomkamp - District 9"
---

A population of debilitated prawn-like aliens is found  aboard an inert alien ship that has appeared over Johannesburg. The South  African government confines them to an internment camp shanty town called  District 9. Twenty years later, a bureaucrat assisting in the relocation of the  aliens to District 10 is accidentally contaminated by contact with an alien  fluid, and begins to metamorphose. He teams up with one of the aliens, assisting  him to escape with his son to the mothership, which departs, leaving 2½ million  of the prawns behind. The human is seen to have completed his transformation.
 
Libcom.org's <a href="https://libcom.org/library/working-class-cinema-video-guide">guide to  working class films</a> gives this description: "Alluding to the District Six  evictions in apartheid and the more recent Blikkiesdorp settlement, District 9  sees aliens come to Earth. But when they arrive, they are a minority group just  like any other, and are hated by both black and white in South Africa."
