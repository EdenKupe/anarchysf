Vittorio Curtoni, writing in 1978, considered _Camp  Concentration_ to be "very fine". It concerns the experimental  treatment of American concentration-camp inmates with a syphilis-derived drug  which enhances intelligence but accelerates death. In 2019 <a href="https://www.anarchistnews.org/content/frr-books-podcast-camp-concentration-thomas-disch">anarchistnews.org</a> published a podcast centred on the novel. In the same year <a href="https://sfbay-anarchists.org/2019/04/">Nev</a>, of the Berkeley Anarchist Study Group, described this novel as "one of the most underrated and unknown novels written by a self identifying anarchist", 
continuing:

Thomas Disch’s truly beautiful and thought provoking novel deals with consciousness, war, the self, education, and what it means to be a person. The novel asks questions that we likely don’t have answers to, but the discussion of these questions cuts to the heart of what I imagine an anarchist study group exists for.

'Mutability' is set in the free university city of Tübingen at the end of the 21st century. Tübingen is said to have been declared a free city by the UN in  2039, after the faculty and students of the university had spearheaded the pan-Germanic Anarchist movement. It is said to have a uniquely democratic government, but American observers seem to be unimpressed.
