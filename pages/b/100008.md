Batman is widely believed to be an urban legend until he  takes on a rising criminal mastermind known as the Joker.
 
Dan Clore posted Robert Anton Wilson's film review "Have  You Ever Danced With the Devil in the Pale Moonlight?" to the anarchy-sf mailing  list in 2005; Wilson considered Batman "an anarcho-surrealist attack on  the conventions of mass market melodrama".
