Post-holocaust novel in which two boys escape a strict religious community to look for a fabled secret community that still preserves technology, after a fashion. Both communities are found to have their downsides.

The book is sympathetically discussed at Evan Lampe's <a href="https://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/leigh-brackett-the-long-tomorrow-1955/">
blog</a>. He notes that "The anarchist critique of technological systems (not technology working on a human scale) is not that dissimilar."
