Acclaimed and successful re-envisioning of a poor 1978 series of the same name.
  
 Post-anarchist academic Lewis Call has written two papers on this series: 'Crisis of Authority Aboard the Battlestar Galactica,' in New  Perspectives on Anarchism (2010) ed. Nathan J. Jun and Shane Wahl; and 'Death, Sex and the Cylon: Living authentically on Battlestar Galactica,'  in Science Fiction Film and Television vol. 5, no. 1 (2012). Neither is  readily available.
