"Religion might be the opiate of the masses, but when pushed by the state, dissension often means death. This sequel to the more famous _A Princess of Mars_ skewers blind faith. One doesnâ€™t usually think of Burroughs [ . . . ] as someone with political ideas expressed in fiction. Yet the vehemence with which John Carter expresses his hatred for the Therns and the aeon-long deception of the other Barsoomian races, makes this book a clear novel for liberty."
