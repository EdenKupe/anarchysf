Part 3 appears to express anarchist sympathies (<a href="http://feministsf.org/quotes/bersianik.html">feministsf.org</a>). Included in  Killjoy's list of stories that feature sympathetic  anarchist characters.
 
It's stretching a point to consider  this sf, though. It's a feminist manifesto, objectivised as the viewpoint of a  visiting alien.
