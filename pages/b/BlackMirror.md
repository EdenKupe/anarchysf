One contributor to the Facebook Anarchism and Science  Fiction Forum in 2015 said she'd been "overwhelmed with the political and  philosophical issues raised on the show." And one answer to a Quora query on "<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-would-an-anarchist-society-deal-with-crime?share=1">How  would an anarchist society deal with crime?</a>" cited Black Mirror as a  "quite chilling" example of one solution.
