For Moorcock, _Swastika Night_ "seems to think that Christianity could conquer Hitler but is otherwise a pretty incisive projection of Nazism several hundred years in the future". (Moorcock 1978)

_The End of This Day's Business_ is rather a curiosity. It's a role-reversal 'utopia' set 4000 years in the future, in which women have become the dominant sex, effectively foregrounding women's oppression 
at the present day, and attacking the rising fascism of the 1930s. But it's not a eutopia, and the inverted oppression is unsurprisingly as deadening as its converse.
