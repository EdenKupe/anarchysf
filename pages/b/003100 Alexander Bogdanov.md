Socialist utopia on Mars, written by an early Bolshevik not long after the 1905  revolution.
 
Suggested by a couple of contributors to Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/?fref=ts"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>, one of whom perceives points of  similarity to Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_. Of only peripheral interest  here.
