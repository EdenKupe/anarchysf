Socialist utopia on Mars, written by an early Bolshevik not long after the 1905  revolution.

Suggested by a couple of contributors to Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/?fref=ts"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>, one of whom perceives points of  similarity to Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_. A quote from _Red Star_ was used as an epigraph to a 2004 <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/365-summer-2004/mars-first/">
article</a> on the space programme in _Fifth Estate_ #365.
