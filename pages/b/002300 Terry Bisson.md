<em>Fire on the Mountain</em> is socialist rather than anarchist, but is an astonishingly convincing alternate history predicated on John Brown's success in the raid at Harper's Ferry in 1859. Of very real interest. It has recently been reviewed in the Winter 2019 <em>Fifth Estate</em> by RB, who finds fault with Bisson's understanding of the true history of the raid, and dislikes what he sees as "Bisson's utopia: a technocratic mega-state that valorizes total domination of nature." In 2025 the Anarchist Federation reprinted an

<em>TVA Baby</em> was recommended in Zeke  Teflon's <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/review-tva-baby-by-terry-bisson/"> review</a>: "If you enjoy concise writing and mordant humor, you’ll enjoy <em>TVA Baby</em>."

In 2010 Terry Bisson moderated a workshop, and in 2012 spoke on 'The Left Left Behind', at the Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair. Rudy Rucker, Terry Bisson and John Shirley were on a panel on Anarchism and Science Fiction at the 2012 Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair, which is available as a <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/mp3/rucker_bisson_shirley_anarchist_book_fair_san_francisco_march_31_2012.mp3"> podcast</a> on Rucker's website. When asked directly, in an interview published in his PM Press <em>The Left Left Behind plus</em>, how he felt about anarchism, Bisson's response was: "As an idea I like it. But I am a big government guy. I'm a TVA baby. Still a Democrat."

_Any Day Now_ is a semi-autobiographical alternate history of the radical 1960s. It's not immediately apparent that it's an alternate history, but the historical paths had diverged by the early 1950s, and in the 1968 of the novel a contested presidential election triggers the fragmentation of the United States. This is the context of a narrative largely set around the communes of the south-west of the US. A useful 2013 <a href="https://kpfa.org/player/?audio=88137">interview</a> with Bisson, centred on this novel, was promoted at anarchistfederation.net following Bisson's death in 2024. In the interview Bisson referred to himself as a communist of the New Left.
