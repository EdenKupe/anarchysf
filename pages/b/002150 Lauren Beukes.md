Excellent South African sf, set so close to the present that the parallel with the COVID-19 pandemic is extraordinary, but in this case it's a novel prostate cancer that has wiped out nearly all men, so that an immune teenage boy is a precious commodity, sought by multiple bad actors. At one point he and his mother stay in an anarchist commune in Utah, the anarchists fairly presented.
