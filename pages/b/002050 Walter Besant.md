200 years in Britain's future, men finally rebel against their subjection to women, following women's earlier overthrow of patriarchy. Although readers were clearly intended to applaud the return to the mores of 1882, it's difficult to see quite why Besant was so enthusiastic as a monarchist, so uninterested in even what passed for democracy in 1882 that all his principal characters are titled aristocrats, and the House of Commons only merits a brief mention as being in abeyance until constituents had gained sufficient experience. SFE finds the work "unwittingly funny" for modern readers.

Included in Nettlau's <em><a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau: Esbozo">Esbozo</a></em>, among a handful of utopias and anti-utopias focussing on women.
