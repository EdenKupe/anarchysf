In Bellamy's influential utopia <em>Looking Backward</em>  the economy of the future United States is highly organized, workers being  organized in an industrial army. We learn that 
 
"Almost the sole function of the administration now is  that of directing the industries of the country. Most of the purposes for which  governments formerly existed no longer remain to be subserved. We have no army  or navy, and no military organization. We have no departments of state or  treasury, no excise or revenue services, no taxes or tax collectors. The only  function proper of government, as known to you, which still remains, is the  judiciary and police system." (Signet Classic edn: 143-4)

Bellamy takes this further in <em>Equality</em>:
 
"A government in the sense of a co-ordinating directory of  our associated industries we shall always need, but that is practically all the  government we have now. It used to be a dream of philosophers that the world  would some time enjoy such a reign of reason and justice that men would be able  to live together without laws. That condition, so far as concerns punitive and  coercive regulations, we have practically attained. As to compulsory laws, we  might be said to live almost in a state of anarchy." (1933 Appleton-Century edn:  409)

This sounds well enough; but, as Marie-Louise Berneri put  it,
 
"Bellamy's state socialism allows a greater degree of  personal freedom than most other utopias based on the same principles. But it is  the freedom which might be granted to soldiers once they have been conscripted;  no provision is made for 'conscientious objectors' (249).

While <em>Looking Backward</em> and its sequel are not in themselves anarchist,  they nevertheless attracted the interest of Peter Kropotkin himself. He reviewed the first at great length (extending over four issues) in <em>Le Révolté</em> at the end of 1889, noting that  "Bellamy's ideal is not ours. But he helps to clarify our own ideas; on many points, without intending to, he confirms them." (Pt 1:1). He concluded:  "Whatever may be the defects of this little book, it will always have done the immense service of suggesting ideas and giving matter for discussion for those who really wish for the social Revolution." (Pt 4:2). Lest there be any doubt, though, he stated right at the start of his article that  "Bellamy n'est pas anarchiste" (Pt 1:1). Kropotkin found <em>Equality</em> certainly not so interesting, but superior in that it analyses  "all the vices of the capitalistic system. . . so admirably that I know of no other Socialist work on this subject that equals Bellamy's <em>Equality</em>." These remarks on <em>Equality</em> come from Kropotkin's obituary notice of Bellamy in <em>Freedom</em>, translated from <em>Les Temps Nouveaux</em>. His final considered opinion:
 
"What a pity that Bellamy has not lived longer! He would  have produced other excellent books. I am positive that were Bellamy to have met  an Anarchist who could have explained to him our ideal, he would have accepted  it. The authoritarianism which he introduced into his Utopia was useless there  and contradictory to the very system. It was simply a survival, a concession, a  tribute to the past."

Franklin Rosemont, in his 1990 introduction to Bellamy's _Apparitions of Things to Come_, argues strongly for Bellamy's radicalism, and notes that Bellamy took on board the criticisms of anarchists and others in writing _Equality_: "In every way the utopia portrayed in the sequel is less regimented, less monolithic, more open, more receptive to the demands of freedom and diversity." (15). For Rosemont, "Bellamy was not only a radical—he was a vehement radical" (12); and "His libertarian, egalitarian, feminist and ecological-oriented socialism, with its eros-affirmative and non-anthropocentric tendencies and strong surrealist affinities, seems to hail not from the past but from a desirable future." (26) The stories in this collection, though very readable, are not themselves of interest here.
