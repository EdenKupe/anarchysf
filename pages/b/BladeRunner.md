title: "Ridley Scott - Blade Runner"
---

Based on the Philip K. Dick novel Do  Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the film depicts a dystopian  Los Angeles in which genetically engineered android replicants are  banned on Earth, but used for dangerous or menial work on off-world  colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and come to Earth are hunted  down and killed by special police operatives known as 'blade  runners'. The plot focuses on a group of recently escaped replicants  hiding in LA and a burnt-out expert blade runner who reluctantly  agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down. Whether or  not the blade runner is himself a replicant is uncertain, forcing an  evaluation of what it means to be human.
 
The 2014 Anarchism <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/2a2r93/can_we_compile_a_list_of_the_top_films_advocating/"> SubReddit</a> thread on films advocating anti-capitalism features an  interesting discussion between two contributors: one recommending  Blade Runner, the other describing the film as "merely dystopian  corporatism". The former rejoins that "the dystopian realm of  Blade Runner is something which is overwhelmingly repulsive, and  it achieves this style by doing nothing but extrapolating the  effects of our current society. Surely then, it is at the very least  portraying the negatives of capitalism in a subconscious manner?"
 
Two contributors to the FB Anarchism and  Science Fiction Forum in 2016 included this film among their shortlists of the best  SF ever committed to film.
 
Matthew Lucas, in his Fifth Estate review of the  film's sequel, observed that the 1982 film "had largely written out much of  Dick's political and ecological concerns."
