Alien astronauts crashland on Earth in 1908 causing, in  the original universe (ours), the Tungus meteorite phenomenon. They represent  themselves as ambassadors from a galactic empire, whilst actually only wishing  to speed up technological progress in order to repair their craft, and have  various escapades with H.G. Wells, Rasputin, Theodore Roosevelt, etc. <em>And  Having Writ . . .</em> is not really in any way anarchist, but it does present a  delightful satire of Earthly ways, and it gently mocks a variety of authority  figures. All in all, great fun.
