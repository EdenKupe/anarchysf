 Intelligent space opera, third of what  <em><a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/brin_david">SFE</a></em> describes  as a 'super-series'. One of Anders Monsen's <a href="http://www.andersmonsen.com/50-works-of-fiction-libertarians-should-read/"> 50 works of fiction libertarians should read</a>; Monsen says "Uplift War deals  with rights and liberties in subtle ways, and remains memorable for very  realistic sketches of interactions between species."
