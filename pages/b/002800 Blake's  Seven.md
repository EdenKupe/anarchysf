The exploits of a political dissident who leads a small  group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation that  rules Earth and its colonies.

The series was much enjoyed by one poster to the old  anarchysf mailing list back in 2000, for whom as a teenager it had been their  favourite TV series: "It had a very '80s hopeless end-of-the world feel to it,  almost gothic."
