title: "Max Barry - Jennifer Government"
---

A dystopian view of a  world entirely run by ruthless global corporations in murderous competition,  with government functions privatised and marginalised.
 'This  isn't freedom, John. It's anarchy.' 'Well,'  John said, 'if you're going to split hairsâ€”' 
A very entertaining black  comedy.
