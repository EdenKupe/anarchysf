<em>Erewhon</em> is a satirical utopia with dystopian  elements, set in New Zealand. Established Western conventions are  overturned—criminals are cured, but sickness punished; churches have become  musical banks; machines have been banned because of fears of their possible role  as evolutionary successors to Homo sapiens. The satire was familiar reading to a number of  anarchists: Marie-Louise Berneri, Angel Cappelletti, Ethel Mannin, Herbert Read,  and George Woodcock all refer to it. In this satire, for Cappelletti, "is shown  the singular taste of the author for inverting ideas and values commonly  accepted, pleasure in turning the world upside down, and a caustic and  subversive use of paradox" . . . (Cappelletti 1966: 27) Gabriel Kuhn, editor of Gustav Landauer's _Revolution and Other Writings_, notes that parts of _Erewhon_ were published in three issues of his paper _Der Sozialist_, and although no translator is named it is "very likely" that it was Landauer himself (n166 on p60).

In Andrew Culp's '<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-culp-dark-deleuze">Dark Deleuze</a>', included in The Anarchist Library, the author devotes a paragraph to the discussion of this work by Deleuze and Guattari, in <em>What is Philosophy?</em>, in which he says they conclude that "For Butler, <em>Erewhon</em> 
summons neither a new people nor a new earth but is instead a field guide to negate everything he finds intolerable in his present. Utopia becomes the map to 
transform the now-here into the no-where."

<em>Erewhon Revisited</em> was bought and read  by Herbert Read in 1915. (Read 1963: 211)
