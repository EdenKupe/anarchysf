What may once have seemed adventurous and futuristic pastiche now seems simply dated, a curiosity of the 60s.

That it was seen at the time as something rather more is demonstrated by the fact that it received no less than two reviews in _Fifth Estate_ #64, October 1968, and both gush ecstatically. Thomas Haroldson described it as "one of the most enjoyable and imaginative movies ever made", and "a damn fine trip". For Hank Malone it was "a banquet of dreams, illusions, and blossoms."
