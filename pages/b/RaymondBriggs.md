Graphic novel in which an elderly couple experience the dropping of a nuclear bomb in England. Well received at the time by reviewers  (two of them children) in two issues of Freedom. In the later review  Julie Southwood wrote:
Â 
With wit, sympathy and simplicity almost unbearable in its  pathos, Briggs illustrates how powerless we all are, once we agree to  leave decisions concerning our 'survival' to any self-appointed elite of  politicians and 'experts' . . . Whatever one's political views, this book  concentrates the mind wonderfully on the real questions: what sort of survival,  for whom, at what price? (Julie Southwood 1982)
