How Bruce Wayne became Batman.

David Graeber wrote interestingly on the _Batman_ trilogy (with a longer version published as 'On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power', in <a href="biblio.htm#Graeber 2015">Graeber 2015</a>). This film, and _The Dark Knight_, he said "had moments of genuine eloquence". Noting that "Bruce Wayne, in the Nolan films, is borderline psychotic", he further said "There's no obvious a political message. Or so it seems." The paragraph concludes that "Nolan made his hero a Black Bloc disciple of John Zerzan who breaks with his former mentor when he realizes what restoring Eden will actually entail." Later on he says "Nolan's villains are always anarchists. But they're also always very peculiar anarchists, of a sort that seem to exist only in the filmmaker's imagination: anarchists who believe that human nature is fundamentally evil and corrupt."
