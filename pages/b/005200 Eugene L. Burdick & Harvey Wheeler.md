Tense thriller in which mechanical failure leads to a US  nuclear attack on Moscow; to convince the Soviet leader that it was a mistake,  the US president is forced to order the tit-for-tat destruction of New York.  John Pilgrim in 1966 considered it to be in the tradition of Chesney's <em>The  Battle of Dorking</em>, but its motivation is very different, being passionately  opposed to nuclear escalation and the arms war.
