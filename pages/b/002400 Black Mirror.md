Superlative near-future anthology series, each episode  free-standing, with different casts.

One contributor to the Facebook Anarchism and Science  Fiction Forum in 2015 said she'd been "overwhelmed with the political and  philosophical issues raised on the show." The series also featured in three posts to the FB Anarchist Film Group in 2023. And one answer to a Quora query on "<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-would-an-anarchist-society-deal-with-crime?share=1">How  would an anarchist society deal with crime?</a>" cited <em>Black Mirror</em> as a  "quite chilling" example of one solution.

A couple of _Black Mirror_ episodes are featured in an article by Alan N. Shapiro reprinted on the Anarchist Federation website.
