In his 1964 essay on political attitudes in SF Brunner  envisaged an automated anarchistic society as a possibility worth exploring in SF  (Brunner 1964: 125). Interviewed in 1979, he said that  "if you had to classify me, you'd have to put me in some vague area like 'fellow-travelling idealistic anarchist.'"  (Platt: 276)

<em>Stand on Zanzibar</em> and <em>The Sheep Look Up</em> are  included in Think Galactic's <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>. _The Sheep Look Up_ met with warm approval from Jeff Robinson, in a <a href="https://greenanarchy.anarchyplanet.org/files/2012/05/greenanarchy14.pdf">review</a> for _Green Anarchy_ in 2012, noting that "_Sheep_ escapes notions of spreading wealth (the sick American brand of equality) to the world, and concludes with the idea that we must remove the richest, most wasteful 2 million people on the planet, and put an end to the exportation of American 
values to the rest of the world."

For Lessa, Takver & Alyx, writing in <em>Open Road</em> in 1978, the  "anarchist city Precipice" of <em>The Shockwave Rider</em> "appears like a jewel in a sea of horror". (13) Congenial and professedly anti-authoritarian as Precipice may be, it can't fairly be described as anarchist, given that it supports sheriff, mayor, courts, lawyers, and a judicial code with mandatory sentences.  It is included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>.

<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/a-few-favorite-atheist-science-fiction-novels-and-books-on-cults/">Teflon</a> described <em>The Crucible of Time</em> as "An inspiring novel about the rise of science and its eventual triumph over religion in an alien society." Personally I found it tedious and barely readable.
