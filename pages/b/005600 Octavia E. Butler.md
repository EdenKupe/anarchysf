<em>Patternmaster</em>—the last of the _Patternist_ series, by internal chronology—is one of the weakest of Butler's  novels, but is nevertheless included in Mark Bould's _Red Planets_ reading list (see bibliography), and is in Dukan's <a href="http://invisibleuniversedoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IU_BSF_lit_2015_3000.jpg"> bibliography</a> as an early work from the first generation of Black Futurists. Lewis Call devotes half a dozen pages to the series, including a page specifically on this novel, in 'Structures of desire', his chapter in Hecker and Cleminson, eds: _Anarchism & Sexuality_. He notes that the hierarchical structure of the Pattern makes it "a tempting target for anarchist critique, which Butler deploys without naming it as such."

_Mind of My Mind_, the second of the _Patternist_ series, is much stronger. Call devotes a page to this novel, in 'Structures of desire', as mentioned above. He disagrees with feminist critics who see in a positive light the community developed by the protagonist, saying that while the regime may be "more nurturing and more organic," nonetheless "it remains a non-consensual slave system".

_Kindred_ is probably Butler's best-known work, and  is by now pretty much a standard text, featuring a complex critique of race and  power relationships in the ante-bellum South, from the viewpoint of an  African-American woman from 1976, who is intermittently pulled back to 1815  whenever her slave-owning white forebear is in danger.

_Wild Seed_ is the first of Butler's _Patternist_ series, in internal sequence. Call devotes half a dozen pages to the series, including a couple of pages specifically on _Wild Seed_, in his 'Structures of desire'. He sees the novel as "a sadomasochistic love story," in which Butler discovered "a kind of erotic play-slavery," which she presents as "an effective strategic and symbolic challenge to a principal character's "ugly, empire-building slavery." He concludes that "A text would have to be kinky _and_ postanarchist to achieve something like that."

For Anu Bonobo, in _Fifth Estate_ #<a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/373-fall-2006/octavia-estelle-butler/">373</a>,
 
"_Dawn_'s most daring maneuver was not the  unattractive aliens on the breathing bio-ship that rescued the xenophobic humans  after a human holocaust—nor even the seemingly benevolent freaks' rejection of  humanity's apparently inherent hierarchies; rather, Butler busted boundaries  with bizarre, kinky, and blissfully psychedelic interspecies sex. Even though  the humans cannot help but like it, do they really want it? As one might  imagine, the issue of permission is problematic here; do the humans choose to  breed with their apparently terrifying and tentacled saviors and captors? Is  this patronizing servitude masked as emancipation?"

The _Xenogenesis_ stories have also been  recommended on the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/search/?query=butler"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>. But <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/"> Zeke Teflon</a> has added a corrective, stressing that the the view that the trilogy is a flawed utopia is "grotesque".

The two _Parable_ books chart the  rise of a movement based on mutual aid (or just common human decency) amid the  breakdown of society in the United  States. Warm and literate, it's unfortunate that the author chose to hang her  principles on a new religion. Malik Muhammad, in a 2025 <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/top-3-summer-reading-recommendations/">blog post</a> copied to anarchistfederation.net, says &quot;if you DON’T know about these books, you must be living under a rock. If you haven’t gotten around to reading them, you’re missing out, and you should carve out some time. Octavia Butler is a wonder. The Orwellian predictions are one thing, but I was just so enthralled by the storytelling. I LOVE a dystopian future road trip novel. It’s NOT a great roadtrip, but her novels, while bleak and realistic, offer hope. She offers “Earthseed,” which I have definitely taken to heart lol. They are full of tragedy, suffering, endurance, hope, and love. I think they match our times 
well."

_Parable of the Talents_ was also reviewed in 2025 by Semiyah in the _Anarchist Review of Books_ #10, who notes that "Octavia Butler's work exemplifies how the mind, body, and spirit will continuously stretch as they strive toward liberation."

Butler's work, and especially the _Parable_ novels, were featured in articles in her memory, by <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/373-fall-2006/octavia-estelle-butler/">Anu Bonobo</a> and 
<a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/373-fall-2006/planting-the-seeds-of-anarchy/">Benjamin Carson</a>, in _Fifth Estate_ in 2006. While Bonobo focuses on her Afrofuturism,  Carson, while relishing the mutual aid depicted, finds Butler's orientation  towards a future in space "deeply troubling".

Bonobo, in _Fifth Estate_ #<a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/373-fall-2006/octavia-estelle-butler/">373</a>,  speaks of the vampire collectives of _Fledgling_ as "bloodlinked free love  communes—of a sort. But since the symbionts need the vampire kiss like a junky  needs his needle, it’s difficult to define this as a liberated relationship." _Fledgling_ is included in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a> as  well as the Swindon Anarchist Group's list of <a href="https://swindonanarchistgroup.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/anarchistresistance-novels/"> anarchist/resistance novels</a>.

'Childfinder' is discussed at some length in Melanie Marie West's <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6cw1300j">dissertation</a> 'Afrofuturism in Practice: Octavia E. Butler Studies and the Production of Politically Engaged Black Speculative Fiction'. She sees the story as key to Butler's future work, as bridging "Afrofuturism, Afro-pessimism and Black Anarchist thought." In particular, 'Childfinder' "reflects the Black autonomous zones which can be found in the organizing practices of Black Anarchists."
