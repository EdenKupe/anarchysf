Gentle comedy, showing incidents in the experience of an  alien slave who has escaped and crash-landed in New York; he appears  African-American, and is pursued by two white alien 'men in black'. Seen as a  classic of Afrofuturism.

Included in the _Red Planets_ filmography (see Bould, bibliography).
