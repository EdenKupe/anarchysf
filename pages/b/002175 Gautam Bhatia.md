Concerns a legal case in which a decision has to be made as to whether or not to revive a man who'd served a hundred years of the 'sleep of death', his sentence for an alleged assassination.

Bhatia's own legal background is evident, but so is his attraction to anarchism. In the novel, the city of Peruma is divided, largely on class lines, with one half known, known as the Commune, explicitly operating on anarchist principles. The future of the Commune may depend on the outcome of the case.

The book has a valuable and informative appendix, in which Bhatia outlines his inspirations, in five sections headed Events, Concepts, Anarchism, Intertextuality, and Others. Under Events, his central inspiration was the 1871 Paris Commune. Under Anarchism, he points to Charlie Allison's biography of Nestor Makhno, as well as paying tribute to Michael Moorcock, and in particular the latter's 'Starship Troopers'; stating that "the influence of anarchism upon this novel goes beyond literary tributes," he states, for example, that the Commune's architecture is modelled on anarchist philosophies of urban planning, referring to Paul Dobraszczyk's _Architecture and Anarchism_; some of the specifics of internal debates in the Commune echo some of the testimonies of survivors of the 1871 Commune. Under Intertextuality, he notes that a conversation towards the end is a tribute to Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_, "the original anarchist SF novel". Under Others, Bhatia even finds time to mention the Zutistes, the anarchic group of French poets, painters, and musicians who met soon after the fall of the Paris Commune.

And in case anyone doubted the author's political sympathies, the conclusion of his Acknowledgements reads "And to all the anarchists—some remembered, many forgotten—who've struggled to 'build the new in the ruins of the old' and left us a language and a legacy that we can now draw upon in our stories: thank you."
