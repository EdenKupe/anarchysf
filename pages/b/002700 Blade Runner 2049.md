Reviewed for the Anarcho-Geek Review by <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/just-like-a-real-girl-blade-runner-2049"> Margaret Killjoy</a>, who loved the cinematography, but deplored its misogyny,  saying the real story was about women, yet it was the two male blade runners who  were the narrative focus: ". . . what got me, what sat under my skin and left me  uncomfortable for an entire day, is just how goddammed many interesting themes  about women, trans and cis alike, could and should have been explored in  <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>."
