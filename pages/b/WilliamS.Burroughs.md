Burroughs's work is difficult to describe or classify, but  most of his books have some SF interest, and among these all the above titles  have been referred to in anarchist publications. The most characteristic and  recurrent of his themes is stated succinctly in The Naked Lunch:
 
" . . . You see control can never be a means to any  practical end . . . . It can never be a means to anything but more control . . .  . Like junk . . ." (164, Calder & Boyars edn).
Dave Cunliffe, in his 1968 Freedom review of The  Soft Machine, summed up Burroughs as "a technological mystic and creative  journalist with liberal and reformist tendencies". But "his inspired solipsistic  vision" (Moorcock 1983: 71) represents more than this: his sympathies are  libertarian and revolutionary. B.P.D., writing in Freedom in 1972, felt that "To  employ the term 'anarchist' to such an individualist thinker as William  Burroughs would be to categorise him wrongly and unnecessarily." But that he  approached closely to anarchism is shown clearly in his 1969 interview with  Daniel Odier, published as The Job. He says he is "very dubious of  politics myself" (47), and believes that "all existing governments are control  machines" (35); and when asked directly whether he believes in the anarchist  solutions for the future he replies
 
I don't really know what they are, although I would say  this, that I don't believe in any solution that proposes halfway measures.  Unless we can abolish the whole concept of the nation, and the whole concept of  the family, we aren't going to get anywhere at all, just nowhere. (65)
He had no illusions about the (then current) hippie  challenge to the system of control: "The only way I like to see cops given  flowers is in a flower-pot from a high window." (67)
 
"While Burroughs work is primarily dystopian, a few anarchistic utopian societies do show up. In The Wild Boys, for example, Burroughs portrays an anarchistic society that consists of roving gangs of dope-smoking, homosexual teenage boys who wear nothing but jockstraps and rollerskates. The trilogy that begins with Cities of the Red Night includes material about several attempts to found libertarian societies, including Libertatia . . . and a group of Rimbaud-reading, dope-smoking, homosexual Zen gunslingers in the Wild West. Ghost of Chance stars Captain Mission and his pirate utopia Libertatia." (Dan Clore)
