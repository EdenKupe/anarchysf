  Shockwave Rider"

In his 1964 essay on political attitudes in SF Brunner  envisaged an automated anarchistic society as a possibility work exploring in SF  (Brunner 1964: 125). Interviewed in 1979, he said that  "if you had to classify me, you'd have to put me in some vague area like 'fellow-travelling idealistic anarchist."  (Platt: 276)
 
Stand on Zanzibar and The Sheep Look Up are  included in Think Galactic's <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.
 
For Lessa, Takver & Alyx, writing in Open Road in 1978, the  "anarchist city Precipice" of The Shockwave Rider "appears like a jewel in a sea of horror". (13) Congenial and professedly anti-authoritarian as Precipice may be, it can't fairly be described as anarchist, given that it supports sheriff, mayor, courts, lawyers, and a judicial code with mandatory sentences.
