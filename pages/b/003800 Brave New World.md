Again, a TV movie adaptation of the Huxley novel, but this  time abridged and updated, with a new ending. Watchable, though.

Included as a dystopia in Black Flag Blog's <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=da&tl=en&u=https://sortefane.wordpress.com/r/anarkisme-og-film/">Anarchism and film</a>.

Reviewed by <a href="http://alexpeak.com/art/films/bnw1980/">Alex Peak</a>, who boldly gives  his view that "this movie is even better than the book". As a libertarian  dystopia, he says, "This is a story primarily about two things: individuality,  and the freedom to have one’s own emotions."
