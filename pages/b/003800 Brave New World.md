Again, a TV movie adaptation of the Huxley novel, but this  time abridged and updated, with a new ending. Watchable, though.
 
Included as a dystopia in Black Flag Blog's   Anarchism and film.
 
Reviewed by <a href="http://alexpeak.com/art/films/bnw1980/">Alex Peak</a>, who boldly gives  his view that "this movie is even better than the book". As a libertarian  dystopia, he says, "This is a story primarily about two things: individuality,  and the freedom to have one’s own emotions."
