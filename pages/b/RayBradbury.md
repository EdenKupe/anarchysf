Portions of The Martian Chronicles have a theme of  liberty, according to <a href="http://lfs.org/newsletter/030/03/FiftyWorks.shtml">Anders Monsen</a>. A  superb and classic collection, in any case.
 
Fahrenheit 451 was described by Daniel Johnson in Freedom in 2014 as a  "dystopian masterpiece". It tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame  Award in 1984. For Jeff <a href="http://mises.org/daily/4650/Revisit-Bradburys-Fahrenheit-451"> Riggenbach</a> this work is "one of the most influential libertarian novels of  the 20th century".
 
Something Wicked This Way Comes  is included in Think Galactic's <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.
 
Although apparently Republican, and a  supporter of George W. Bush, in an interview with Time magazine in 2010  Bradbury <a href="http://prometheus-unbound.org/2012/06/16/article-ray-bradbury-anarchist-at-heart/"> said</a>:
 
I don’t believe in government. I hate politics. I’m  against it. And I hope that sometime this fall, we can destroy part of our  government, and next year destroy even more of it. The less government, the  happier I will be.
