title: "Lizzie Borden - Born in Flames"
---

Strongly feminist documentary-style film,  cheaply filmed on 16 mm and video, set in a near future  social-democratic America. Two women's groups running pirate radio  stations turn to direct action after their premises are burned out. 
 
Richard Porton, in his Film and the  Anarchist Imagination, devotes four pages to an analysis of  Born in Flames, finding it, "despite its dystopian scenario, a  more optimistic evocation of contemporary currents within  anarcho-feminism". He further notes that "From a broader historical  vantage point, her fantasia on anarchist themes recapitulates  debates between anarchism and social-democratic antagonists such as  George Bernard Shaw." Porton found that the film "proved most  scandalous, both within the feminist movement and outside it, by  resisting the temptation to condemn definitively the use of  revolutionary violence." This he sees as a "strategic provocation",  in the context of the celebration of the Greenham Common pacifist  activism of the time by many radical women who "ascribed to women a  state of natural non-violence" which Borden found "dubiously  essentialist."
 
Shown at the film festival that formed part of  the Boston anarchist bookfair in 2011, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120503045118/http:/bostonanarchistbookfair.org/film-festival"> programme</a> for which describes it as exploring racism, classism,  sexism and heterosexism. Shown as part of the if I can’t dance  to it, it’s not my revolution exhibition at Haverford,  Pennsylvania, curated by Natalie Musteata in 2014, who described it  as both "The movie that rocked the foundations of the early Indie  film world" and "The film that heralded the arrival of Queer  Cinema". Also screened by the Toronto Anarchist Reading Group in  July 2016. Also shown in 2017 at a 3-day anarchist mini-film  festival in Petersham, Sydney, Australia; the <a href="http://www.jura.org.au/node/2938">blurb</a> says the film  "suggests the insufficiency of a radicalism that restricts itself to  politics."
 
Brian Bergen-Aurand lists the film as number 3  in his <a href="http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2015/20-great-anarchist-movies-that-are-worth-your-time/3/"> great anarchist movies that are worth your time</a>, saying "The  film emphasizes alternative aesthetics, direct (rather than  representative) democracy, and women’s roles in what is deemed as  'necessary violence."
 
Lizzie Borden, when asked if she was  comfortable with being described as an anarcha-feminist, <a href="http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/video/review/lizzie_borden.html"> replied</a>:
 
I’m comfortable with it by process of  elimination because I never quite figured out what it is, but I feel  closer to it than any other political identification. I’m so  critical of any kind of organized left wing just because of  bureaucracy really becoming another class, and the relationship of  women to whatever organized left there is. So, the idea of anarchism  has always appealed to me simply because it’s always calling into  question that which is. I somehow see anarchism as that. I see it as  not necessarily excluding different political identifications. For  example, on one issue it might be possible to side with a socialist  stance, on another issue a very Western stance. But the thing about  anarchism is that it allows you not to have to be over-programmed.  The other thing is about feminists. What gets me now is people  saying that they’re not feminist anymore. Feminism is such a mild  word for how I consider myself, that I’m absolutely a feminist.  Anarcha-feminism to me has always been about stirring things up. You  try to constantly ask those questions which will prevent stasis from  setting in. Even at the expense of sometimes being seen as  contradictory or saying things that go against what you said a year  before or a minute before. For me it’s a process. We all know what’s  wrong with Western capitalism and we all know what’s wrong with the  extreme left, so anarcha-feminism—it just seems to be the only  viable identification, if one is to identify at all.
