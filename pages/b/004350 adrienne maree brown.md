A fine opener to the AK Press anarchist Black Dawn series. A mystery pandemic sweeps Detroit, a lone woman trying to make sense of what's happening.

For Carrie Laben, reviewing the work for _The Anarchist Review of Books #3_ (Winter/Spring 2022), it is "inseparable from history", and brown "has laid out a possible future for those communities, one founded on love and mutual aid in the face of official indifference and cruelty." She concludes that "it's hard to imagine a more accurate picture of the moment that everything changed, or of the forever that preceded and followed it."
