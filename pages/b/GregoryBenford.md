In 1980 Benford said, in an interview with Charles Platt,  that
 
. . . many social issues could be solved by simple  rational planning—I don't mean top-down planning, but by using the adroitness  and competitive spirit of the small scale. In that sense, I'm sort of an  unvarnished capitalist, not because I believe in the ownership of things, but  because I believe small units are useful. You could as easily call me an  anarchist. (Platt 1980: 285)
