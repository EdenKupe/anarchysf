title: "Patrick Bair - The Tribunal"
---

The Tribunal is a lightweight near-future political  thriller, involving the declaration of independence of Acquitaine and the  attempted destruction of the leaning tower of Pisa; the anarchists, who also  smuggle arms into Acquitaine, saw the leaning tower as a symbol of government  because, although it will eventually fall, its fall can be accelerated by  gunpowder.
