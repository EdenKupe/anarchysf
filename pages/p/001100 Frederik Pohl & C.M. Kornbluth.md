One of the best-known of 1950s SF novels, the cynical dystopia of _The Space Merchants_ is a strong attack on advertising and consumerism; for the advertising company boss,  "'Power ennobles. Absolute power ennobles absolutely'" (c. 4). For M. Eagle  "There can be few more biting (or amusing) satires of capitalism-gone-wild"; and Vittorio Curtoni also found it  "a most enjoyable novel which dismantles and overturns [the] mechanisms of cosmic imperialism." (25) The novel is the subject of one of Evan Lampe's <a href="https://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/frederick-pohl-and-c-m-kornbluth-the-space-merchants-1953/">blog</a> posts, as well as of a short <a href="http://obsolete-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/obso10finalwatermarksample.pdf">piece</a> by Rich Dana in _Obsolete_ #10 in 2017; Dana found the novel prescient, and "one of the great novels of the SF genre."Â 

_Gladiator-at-Law_ features big-business intrigue, in which a house-production monopoly is overthrown by a motley crew of the dispossessed. Pilgrim found it notable, and unusual in that the insurrection is successful. (Pilgrim 1963: 371)
