Plodding but worthy  attempt at describing how the syndicalist revolution took place in a near-future  France. The clunky English translation doesn't help.
 
Kropotkin advises that too much attention should not be given to the detail.  Rather, what the book seeks to give is "the general idea of the revolution", to  borrow Proudhon's phrase. Also, clearly, "it is not Anarchism that they picture  for us." But:

"In this book of Pataud's and Pouget's can be felt [ . . . ] the life-giving breath of  Anarchism in their conceptions of the future, especially in the pages  devoted to Production and Exchange. And what they say on this subject should  be seriously considered by every worker who loves Freedom, Justice, and  Equality, as well as by everyone anxious to avoid the sanguinary struggles  of a coming Revolution. [Preface: xxxiv]"
