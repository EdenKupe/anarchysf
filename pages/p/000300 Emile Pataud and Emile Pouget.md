Plodding but worthy  attempt at describing how the syndicalist revolution took place in a near-future  France. The clunky English translation doesn't help.

The work was reviewed in <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Freedom-1913-06.pdf">_Freedom_</a> in 1913. The unnamed reviewer found the work "remarkably 
interesting", and "a bold attempt to foretell the course of a future Revolution", concluding that "The book is full of ideas for revolutionists, and the authors' optimism is very stimulating."

Kropotkin's preface advises that too much attention should not be given to the detail.  Rather, what the book seeks to give is "the general idea of the revolution", to  borrow Proudhon's phrase. Also, clearly, "it is not Anarchism that they picture  for us." But:

"In this book of Pataud's and Pouget's can be felt [ . . . ] the life-giving breath of  Anarchism in their conceptions of the future, especially in the pages  devoted to Production and Exchange. And what they say on this subject should  be seriously considered by every worker who loves Freedom, Justice, and  Equality, as well as by everyone anxious to avoid the sanguinary struggles  of a coming Revolution. [Preface: xxxiv]"

In his 1919 Afterword to _Words of a Rebel_ Kropotkin said that "though I differ with Pouget over certain details, I recommend this book with confidence to all those who understand that humanity is unquestionably on the threshold of a social reconstruction."

The book was much later reviewed by <a href="https://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/pzgp5p">Lyman Tower Sargent</a> in the second series of <a href="https://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/pzgp5p">
_Anarchy_</a> magazine, in 1972. Sargent found the authors' optimism excessive, saying "I think we must be self-consciously pessimistic in such situations. An anarchist society will not be produced by assuming that at every possible crisis the opposition will be stupid and we will be brilliant."

Most recently (June 2023) the work was reviewed again by Rob Ray, at

_Freedom_</a>, who concludes that "It marked perhaps the last true high point of belief in the potential of the anarcho-syndicalist forms of revolt that had swept France and Britain through the early 1910s, a belief that would sputter and start through the first world war and its aftermath, but not reach its true height until the revolution neared in 1930s Spain."

The work is also discussed in Zoe Baker's 2023 _<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/zoe-baker-means-and-ends">Means and Ends</a>_, which draws attention to their unusual, and science fictional, approach to how an armed uprising might happen: "Pouget and Pataud’s account of how this would happen was, by far, the most eccentric. In their novel, they depicted the forces of reaction, including the invading armies of foreign states, being easily defeated by a variety of science-fiction weapons. This included electromagnetic waves that caused far away enemy ammunition to explode and aerial torpedoes dropped from remote-controlled planes.These weapons were so ridiculous for the time that it is unclear if the authors seriously advocated them, or merely intended to entertain the reader."
