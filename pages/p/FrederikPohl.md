title: "Frederik Pohl - 'The Tunnel Under the World' (1955); The Years of the City"
---

Vittorio Curtoni called the 1955 story a "great  masterpiece", "like a Kafkaesque nightmare transposed to our days." (Curtoni  1978) Red Planets lists this story and  'The Midas Plague' as "Among the very best 1950s SF satires."

The Years of the City depicts New York in the 21st  century. The political system is what is known as 'demarchy', a form of decentralized  participatory democracy in which  all government offices are filled by average citizens chosen using a form of  selective service, with an overall goal of reducing bureaucracy and legislation.
