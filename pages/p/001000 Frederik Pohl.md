Bould's _Red Planets_ lists the two short stories as "Among the very best 1950s SF satires." Vittorio Curtoni called 'The Tunnel Under the World' a "great  masterpiece", "like a Kafkaesque nightmare transposed to our days." (Curtoni  1978)

_The Years of the City_ depicts New York in the 21st  century. The political system is what is known as 'demarchy', a form of decentralized  participatory democracy in which  all government offices are filled by average citizens chosen using a form of  selective service, with an overall goal of reducing bureaucracy and legislation.
