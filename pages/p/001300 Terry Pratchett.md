Just two of Pratchett's long-running Discworld series: more fantasy than sf, but too good to omit here, showcasing British-flavoured dark humour.

_Feet of Clay_ was singled out for Anders Monsen's <a href="https://andersmonsen.com/50-works-of-fiction-libertarians-should-read/">50 works of fiction libertarians should read</a>, noting that "While another one of Pratchett's novels won the Prometheus Award (_Night Watch_), and there are rich veins of anti-authoritarian and anti-bureaucratic ideas in his other Discworld books, I believe that _Feet of Clay_ hews closer to the libertarian ideals of individual freedom, and so I picked this book."

_Night Watch_ was a worthy winner of the 2003 Prometheus award, and included in LibraryThing's <a href="http://www.librarything.com/tag/anarchism,+science+fiction">anarchism, science fiction</a> tagmash.

In 2016 Sadie the Goat praised the Discworld series, and especially the central character, police commander Samuel Vimes, in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327195940/ttp:/www.anarchogeekreview.com/opinion/fictional-cops-i-love-ranked-by-how-guilty-i-as-an-anarchist-feel-for-loving-them">opinion piece</a> at Anarcho-Geek Review, refusing to feel guilty for liking him: "<strong>Guilt levels:</strong> So low they're past the elephants and sinking to the level of the turtle's shell. I refuse to feel bad about liking Sam Vimes. Fight me."
