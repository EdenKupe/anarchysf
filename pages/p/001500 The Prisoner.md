"I am not a number. I am a free man!"

Anyone not yet familiar with this TV  masterpiece is behind on their homework. I don't propose to describe  it or offer plot summaries here, but restrict myself to its  reception by libertarians of the left as well as the right, both  camps sharing common ground in the defiant individualism and refusal  to conform of the central character, Number Six, not to mention the  brilliant realisation of the micro-dystopia that is The Village.

Reason.com has shown its approval of _The  Prisoner_ on a number of occasions: it was the only SF series <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/10/01/the-5-best-libertarian-tv-shows-ever"> listed</a> among the site's "five television shows all libertarians should watch", and <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2010/01/12/liberals-and-libertarians-at-t"> shortlisted</a> as libertarian sci-fi, as well as being <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2004/03/05/the-libertarian-film-festival#comment"> dubbed</a> libertarian for both featuring individualist heroes and  "incredibly oppressive systems that crush the human spirit."

But the most extended libertarian critique is  Chris R. Tame's 6-page article <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libre/libre001.pdf"> Different Values. An Analysis of Patrick McGoohan's <i>The Prisoner</i></a>,  first published in _New Libertarian Review_ in 1974. For Tame  "The theme of The Prisoner was strikingly clear, then: the Man  versus the State, Autonomy and Individualism versus  Regimentation and Conformity, the Individual versus the  Collective." [Tane's emphasis]

"McGoohan's basic theme throughout _The Prisoner_ was surely that responsibility for our lives and our society resides within ourselves—within the self. In other words, it is the 'sanction of the victim' upon which the despotism of State and Society ultimately rests. The individual can resist and question authority and the dominant social values, or he can, as most people in fact do, abdicate the responsibility, abdicate autonomy and individuality, and succumb to Society. It is within 'Number 1', one's self, that the decision is made as to whether one is a 'prisoner' of Society or not."

For Tane, too, "Technically, _The Prisoner_ was brilliant, certainly the most imaginative and dazzling television series ever executed."

He concluded: "The Prisoner will always remain an inspiration to those involved in the struggle for individualism and liberty, to those who will "not be pushed, filed, indexed, stamped, briefed, debriefed, or numbered" and who wish to make their life their own." 

The series won a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2002, so far the only TV series ever to have achieved this distinction.

In 2017, fully 50 years since the series' first broadcast, it still seems reasonable that the entry in <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/prisoner_the">_SFE_</a> should conclude that _The Prisoner_ "is in the opinion of many—often those discontented with Space Opera—the finest sf television series to date."
