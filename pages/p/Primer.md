Complex and cerebral, the film concerns the accidental  discovery of limited time travel, the storyline unravelling with recursive  iterations. Technically slick, especially considering its phenomenally low  budget ($7000).
 
Included in the Red  Planets filmography, where it's described as a "Dystopian vision of the  inescapable here-and-now."
