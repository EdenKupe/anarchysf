Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about eco-activists engaged in direct action to preserve ancient forest, the sciences here being ecology and botany, with the author showing exceptional empathy for the interconnectedness of life.

The book is discussed in Francis Hines's 2021 PhD thesis on <a href="https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/download/8f7194a6295313bc455780ff54fe7f879180c10b073cd74a2ed36c984a7c9883/31143374/Francis%20Hines%20Full%20thesis%20December%202021.pdf">Evading Representation: The Literature of Contemporary U.S. Anarchism</a>. Hines considers it "a chronicle of contemporary American radicalism that traces arboreally-mediated encounters both between individuals and between political movements." He further notes that "The Overstory indicates the ways security culture, which would appear to hamper textuality, is in fact productive of new identities and new relationships. Yet Powers’ novel also circles around certain vexing questions about the possibility of maintaining a meaningfully rebellious way of life within the totality of industrial civilisation. While seeking, in their own modest way, to fight back against deforestation, Powers’ characters repeatedly confront the ways their own lives cannot be uncomplicatedly situated outside of capitalist modernity."

The novel was described as "magisterial" by <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/643d1e231328fe7f8ec70007/t/644fdd046bbbd662bfe7c6e9/1682955533898/DOPE+18+spreads.pdf">Paul Dobraszczyk</a> in Summer 2022's _Dope_ magazine, noting that the novel's centrepiece was "probably inspired by Julia 'Butterfly' Hill’s 738-day occupation of a threatened Californian Redwood in the late-1990s.
