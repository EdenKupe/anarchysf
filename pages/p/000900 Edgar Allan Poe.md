In his writing, but not in his politics, Poe was much influenced by William Godwin. Godwin actually lived long enough for one of his late works (_Lives of the Necromancers_) to be reviewed by Poe in the  _Southern Literary Messenger_ (December 1835). Poe was appreciated by the individualist Ã‰mile Armand, who instigated the publication of a French translation of Poe's _The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket_ (1838), and of a collection of his tales, at the turn of the 20th century.
