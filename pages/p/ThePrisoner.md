"I am not a number. I am a free man!"
 
Anyone not yet familiar with this TV  masterpiece is behind on their homework. I don't propose to describe  it or offer plot summaries here, but restrict myself to its  reception by libertarians of the left as well as the right, both  camps sharing common ground in the defiant individualism and refusal  to conform of the central character, Number Six, not to mention the  brilliant realisation of the micro-dystopia that is The Village.
 
Reason.com has shown its approval of The  Prisoner on a number of occasions: it was the only SF series <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/10/01/the-5-best-libertarian-tv-shows-ever"> listed</a> among the site's "five television shows all libertarians should watch", and <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2010/01/12/liberals-and-libertarians-at-t"> shortlisted</a> as libertarian sci-fi, as well as being <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2004/03/05/the-libertarian-film-festival#comment"> dubbed</a> libertarian for both featuring individualist heroes and  "incredibly oppressive systems that crush the human spirit."
 
But the most extended libertarian critique is  Chris R. Tame's 6-page article <a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libre/libre001.pdf"> Different Values. An Analysis of Patrick McGoohan's <i>The Prisoner</i></a>,  first published in New Libertarian Review in 1974. For Tame  "The theme of The Prisoner was strikingly clear, then: the Man  versus the State, Autonomy and Individualism versus  Regimentation and Conformity, the Individual versus the  Collective."
