title: "Laurie Penny - Everything Belongs to the Future; The House of Surrender"
---

The author describes the novella as "a near-future  quasi-dystopian anarchist fable about biotechnology, surveillance, state  violence, love and time." [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SolarpunkAnarchists/?fref=ts">interview</a>] Activists (nowhere described as anarchists or  anarcho-syndicalists, notwithstanding the advance publicity) steal anti-aging  pills from gerontocrats to distribute them freely to the local dispossessed, but are betrayed by a  police nark. Though described on the Facebook Solarpunk Anarchists page as an  anarcha-feminist, Penny refers to herself as "a pinko queer feminist social  justice warrior" (though on her Twitter feed in 2018 she does indeed  describe herself as anarcha-feminist).

'The House of Surrender' was noted by Zakk Flash, on Facebook's Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, as "A short story set in a voluntary jail in an anarchist society."
