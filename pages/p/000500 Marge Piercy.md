_Dance the Eagle to Sleep_ tells of an attempt by a  group of student revolutionaries to set up a communistic alternative society  within an oppressive near future USA. Very much of its period. It was deemed  "pretty good" by a contributor to Anarchy 101's <a href="http://anarchy101.org/4872/what-is-your-favorite-anarchist-novel">What  is your favorite anarchist novel?</a> As of September 2018, it's included in  Nick Mamatas's <a href="https://storybundle.com/anarchist">Anarchist StoryBundle</a>.

_Woman on the Edge of  Time_ concerns a woman who is confined in a mental hospital whose only escape is into the future, to what Lessa, Takver and Alyx, in _Open Road_, call "the future-anarchist village" of Matapoisett.  In the novel, Piercy herself doesn't use the term 'anarchist', although there is indeed no government: the closest thing to it are the township and regional planning councils, which are chosen by lot. However, in her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/29/woman-on-the-edge-of-time-40-years-on-hope-imagining-utopia-marge-piercy"> introduction</a> to the 2016 edition she says: "Like most women’s utopias, the  novel is profoundly anarchist and aimed at integrating people back into the  natural world and eliminating power relationships." The book was enthusiastically reviewed in _Anarchist Feminist Magazine_ in 1985.  It is included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>, and recommended in Scott Branson's 2022 _Practical Anarchism_.

_He, She and It_ was recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel 'Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction', at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009. The work is also particularly referenced in Schuhmann's 2024 <a href="https://www.graswurzel.net/gwr/2024/10/anarchistische-zukuenfte/">Anarchist Futures</a>. The novel's free town of Tikva is seen by Tom Moylan, in his 2000 _Scraps of the Untainted Sky_, as partly based on a foundation of "libertarian socialism with a strong admixture of anarcho-feminism." [p253]

Of her own politics, Piercy has <a href="http://www.bigecho.org/marge-piercy/">said</a> "I learned a lot from  Marxism but probably lean more toward syndicalist anarchism."
