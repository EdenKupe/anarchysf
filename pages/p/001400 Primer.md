Complex and cerebral, the film concerns the accidental  discovery of limited time travel, the storyline unravelling with recursive  iterations. Technically slick, especially considering its phenomenally low  budget ($7000).

Included in Bould's _Red  Planets_ filmography, where it's described as a "Dystopian vision of the  inescapable here-and-now."

William Gillis, at <a href="http://humaniterations.net/2009/12/31/top-10-sf-films-of-the-decade/">Human Iterations</a>, describes the film as "most impressive as an accidental critique of capitalist culture."

Recommended on one of the Anarchism sub-Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1953qj/have_you_any_movie_recommendations_containing/"> discussions</a>; and shortlisted as Best sci-fi ever committed to film, by one  contributor to the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction forum.
