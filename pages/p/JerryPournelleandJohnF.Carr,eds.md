title: "Jerry Pournelle and John F. Carr, eds - The Survival of Freedom"
---

Very dated (Cold War)  libertarian anthology of essays and SF short stories. Includes two short essays  by the anarcho-capitalist David Friedman, including 'Why Anarchy?', with a  lukewarm introductory note by Pournelle. It won the Libertarian Futurist Society  Hall of Fame Award in 2001.
