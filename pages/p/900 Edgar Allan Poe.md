In his writing, but not in his politics, Poe was much influenced by William Godwin. Godwin actually lived long enough for one of his late works (Lives of the Necromancers) to be reviewed by Poe in the  Southern Literary Messenger (December 1835). Poe was appreciated by the individualist Émile Armand, who instigated the publication of a French translation of Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838), and of a collection of his tales, at the turn of the 20th century.
