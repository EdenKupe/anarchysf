In 2025 _Freedom_ published a thoughtful reflection by Taib Hayat, on <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/07/12/northern-lights-at-30/">"Northern Lights" at 30</a>. For Hayat, "_His Dark Materials_ is, first and 
foremost, a story about free will—and about people who refuse to be told they can’t think for themselves. "It taught me," he says, "a healthy dose of suspicion towards authority and that we live in only one of an infinite number of possible worlds."
