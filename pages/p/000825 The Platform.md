SF/horror set inside a monolithic tower with two inhabitants on each level and a platform descending from the top providing food, which inevitably is all entirely consumed long before it reaches the bottom level; inhabitants of the lower floors are reduced to cannibalism. Inhabitants are periodically redistributed at random throughout the block, so that everyone has experience of both plenty and starvation. The message seems to be that people are all basically the same, it's the system that's to blame; but this is rather crass, as that's the premise in the first place.
