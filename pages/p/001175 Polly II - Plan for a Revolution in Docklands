Ambitious <a href="https://vimeo.com/553524915">short film</a> set in a submerged Docklands in east London, with a cast of local amateur actors and housing activists. The Polly reference is to the sequel to John Gay's 1727 _Beggar's Opera_. The imagined insurrection is easily read as a comment on the social struggles against gentrification and privatisation.

The film has a fulsome 2008 <a href="https://libcom.org/library/craven-new-world-film-review-tom-jennings">review</a> by Tom Jennings, at libcom.org, in which he lauds it as a "marvellous carnivalesque allegory".
