This is the first volume of an innovative and (perhaps overly?) complex tetralogy, in course of publication. Notably it features a post-capitalist world 400 years hence in which the nation state no longer exists, discussion of religion is disallowed, and gender attribution is largely irrelevant. Organisation is organised by macro-scale affinity groups operating sundry polities which people can opt into or out of. There is also much interplay with the world of the 18th century Enlightenment, with intelligent discussion of notable figures such as Diderot and de Sade.

A whole <a href="https://player.fm/series/anarchysf-an-anarchist-science-fiction-podcast/too-like-the-lightning-and-enlightenment">anarchySF podcast</a> was devoted to this work in September 2020. For Yanai Sened it is "As well thought out a utopia as I could imagine", but Eden Kupermintz commented that it also demonstrates that there is an inescapable price to utopia.
