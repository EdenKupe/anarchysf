Follows a voyage to Jupiter in a spacecraft under the  control of the sentient computer HAL 9000, after the discovery of a mysterious  black monolith that apparently nurtures human evolution. The best and most  significant SF film yet made.

Schembrie's '<a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2009/05/joe-schembrie/expect-a-libertarian-future/">Science  Fiction and Libertarianism</a>' draws attention to the anti-government aspect,  in that "the government so badly botches an attempt to contact extraterrestrials  that the spaceship computer kills the crew."
