A time traveller sent back to 1996 to trace  the source of a virus that had wiped out five billion people is  haunted by his childhood memory of seeing the fatal shooting of his  own adult self. A feature-length re-envisioning of Chris Marker's  1962 short _La Jet√©e_.

One contributor to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>, in November 2016, listed  this film alone as his idea of the best SF ever committed to film.
