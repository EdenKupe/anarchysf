Excellent short adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's  'Harrison Bergeron', featuring one individual's rebellion against a  dystopian US _reductio ad absurdum_ in which the drive for  'equality' has been so total that a 'handicapper general' ensures  all physical and mental aptitudes are forcibly reduced to the lowest  common denominator.

Reviewed enthusiastically by <a href="http://alexpeak.com/art/films/2081/">Alex Peak</a>, for  whom this is "a simply-breathtaking libertarian short ﬁlm." Peak  says the film is not about any authentic concept of equality:  "Rather, this is an objectively authoritarian perversion of  equality, the real aim of which is the subjugation by the state of  its subjects, and the obliteration of individualism. Fortunately,  the state turns out to be incapable of entirely destroying the  extraordinary." This is a rather rose-tinted view, however, of the  film's bleak ending.
