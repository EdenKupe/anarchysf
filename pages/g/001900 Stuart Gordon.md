Sir Humfrey Gylberte and other figures from the past are  plunged into 1990 by a US Navy experiment. 'Humf', as he becomes, eventually  throws in his lot with the lorry people, who are a sort of hippie-anarchic  travelling community. This is apparently in fulfilment of the Egyptian priestess  Tari's sense of their destiny. An earlier exchange with Humf had outlined this:
 
"I told you," she said patiently. "We work towards  self-responsibility so that the need of hidden elite groups is reduced!"

"Spiritual socialism?" I asked bitterly.

"More precisely, it is _an-archy_, meaning '_without  a ruler_,' or perhaps I should say, '_without_ earthly _ruler_,'  for it's impossible to gain such a state without some common sense of  things within and beyond, through which we are, in fact and always, united."  (1984 Arrow pb edn: 262)

The novel, though entertaining, is poorly unified, and  it's doubtful what lessons, if any, can be drawn.
