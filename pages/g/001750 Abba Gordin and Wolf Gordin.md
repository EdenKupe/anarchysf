The Gordin brothers were very actively involved in the Russian anarchist movement in the period of the revolution, and subsequent years. Victor Serge wrote the following of them in 1921:

"[t]he two Gordin brothers have played a key role in the Russian anarchist movement of these past few years. Tireless orators and propagandists, prolific writers, journalists, pamphleteers, and initiators of multiple enterprises, combatants at the barricades of July and October 1917, thanks to their ever-working imaginations they have greatly contributed to creating and sustaining both the life and the waste of this movement."

In the late 1920s both departed for the United States; Abba became a co-editor of the New York Yiddish-language anarchist journal _Freie Arbeiter Stimme_.

_Anarchy in a Dream_ is evidently an anarchist utopia. Life there is apparently "based primarily on the rejection of the rationalistic scientific consciousness of the world" [<a href="https://ttolk-ru.translate.goog/?p=24774&_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB">Russian Anarchist Utopias of the 1920s</a>], and

"The world of Anarchy is based on the principle of Bakunin: "We presume that we first destroy and then we create, because the destruction is the spirit of creation". The Gordins consolidate the ideological basis. In other works, they develop so-argued their refusal to contemporary science and develop a non-Aristotelian logic – like non-Euclidean geometry – by eliminating one of its axioms, the law of 'excluded middle'. Considering that two proposals that contradict each other can be simultaneously false and can therefore be denied, they deduce a 'logic of pure negation'."

The work is described at some length in Jesse Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations. Science, Fantasy, and the Radical Imagination on a Troubled Planet_, with a good number of longish translated quotations. There isn't space here to do justice to Cohn's discussion which, however, strongly suggests the need for a good English translation.
