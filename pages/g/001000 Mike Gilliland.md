Described by its publisher as "A novel of love, hope and revolution, set in the very near future, on an island off the coast of Britain. From the underground to revolution, repression and resistance! Essential. The first great contemporary anarchist novel." Frank Jackson, in a 1986 review in the <a href="http://www.thesparrowsnest.org.uk/collections/public_archive/PAR0106.pdf">_New Anarchist Review_</a>, found it "A raw visionary book that touches a  hopeful chord." The same year saw a much less favorable review by Peter Werbe in<i> <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/324-fall-1986/the-free/">Fifth Estate</a></i> #324, who concluded that "the message still remains murky. A book which chooses a fictional scenario from an infinite number of possible ones to show a wheel of endless repression certainly doesn’t act as inducement to revolt, but maybe Gilliland wants to present a strong dose of the reality before a road of illusions is set out upon."

There is an  online essay entitled "What can M.  Gilliland's _The Free_ contribute to an understanding of the conceptual  structure of modern British class struggle anarchism?" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/1346/pThefreehtml.htm"> here</a>. See also Cohn: 201-2, 223.

The author says the later editions are "3 times as long and 10 times better, with lots more humour, sex and  triumphing alternatives". In his list of the novel's themes (at the end of  the text) he says "The Free are inspired by the anarchist fiesta, trying out  Pete Kropotkin's cut on Darwin. Cooperation in tooth and claw."

_The Free_ gives an exceptionally vivid  account of the exhilaration of the revolutionary process, with strongly imagined  characters and very believable dialogue. Potentially inspirational.
