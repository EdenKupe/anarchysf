A future of sexual apartheid, with men in the cities and  women in the hills, seen exclusively from the women's point of view; the women  have developed nebulous psi powers and communicate freely with animals and birds  as well as each other.
 
Widely noted as among the feminist utopias of the second  wave of the feminist movement (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/29/woman-on-the-edge-of-time-40-years-on-hope-imagining-utopia-marge-piercy"> Piercy</a>, for example). Described by <a href="biblio.htm#Red Planets">Mark  Bould</a> as a "Lesbian feminist utopia."
