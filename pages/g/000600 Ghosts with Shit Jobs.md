Set in 2040 Toronto, after the economic collapse of the  West and the ascendancy of China, this is a mock documentary about ridiculous  jobs held by Americans, supposedly made for the amusement of a Chinese audience.  Each storyline has a different director. The jobs featured are a digital  janitor, who has to manually cover up logos for copyright reasons in a future  version of StreetView; a couple who assemble robot baby dolls for the children  of the wealthy; two collectors of spider silk; and a human spammer who makes a  living by mentioning brands and products in casual conversation.

The film was shown at the 2013 <a href="http://diy-film.com/2013/04/21/the-chicago-anarchist-film-festival-426-428/"> Chicago Anarchist Film Festival</a>, with one of the directors present for a Q &  A.
