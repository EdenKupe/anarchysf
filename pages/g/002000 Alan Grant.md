Lightweight comic-book, but strong on anarchist  propaganda, with a teenage protagonist.

<a href="https://c4ss.org/content/46543"> Logan Marie Glitterbomb</a>  has a paragraph on Anarky as "used to spread Grant’s anarchist philosophy". It also earns a page in Elliot Murphy's 2014 _Unmasking Merlin. Anarchist Tendencies in English Literature_, and more recently (2023) a chapter by Fernando Gabriel Pagnoni Berns and Eduardo Veteri entitled 'Batman, Defender of the Status Quo. On Anarchy and Anarky', in Marco Favaro and Justin F. Martin, eds: _Batman's Villains and Villainesses_.
