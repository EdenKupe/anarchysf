Grave was a notable activist in the French anarchist and international anarchist communism movements, and the editor of three major anarchist periodicals, _Le Révolté, La Révolte_ and _Les Temps Nouveaux_. Among his books was this short fantasy, described in the 2014 _Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary_ as a "libertarian utopia for children". Nettlau, in his [_Esbozo_](https://materialesfopep.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/max-nettlau-esbozo-de-historia-de-las-utopc3adas.pdf), notes that this was used as a second reading book in Ferrer's Modern School in Barcelona, which opened in the year of its publication; in this work, according to Ferrer, "the happier future is ingeniously and dramatically contrasted with the sordid realities of the present order" [quoted by Judith Suissa in the 2019 _Palgrave Handbook of Anarchism_].

The text itself is no longer of any great interest, however.
