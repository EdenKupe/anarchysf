Set in 2000, with New York an independent city state, as  SF it's otherwise not of great interest, and such anarchism as it includes  conforms to contemporary negative stereotypes. In the words of the Mayor, 

"They are frankly anarchists, they assert the solidarity  of chaos, the unity of discord, the prosperity of idleness, the stability of  disorder. Their philosophy is a jumble of contradictions. But worse, they are  self-elected criminals, or else they are hopelessly mad."
(Dillingham edn: 98)

Long and tedious.
