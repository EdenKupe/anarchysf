This much-anthologised tale is discussed in a long paragraph of Jesse Cohn's 
<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jesse-cohn-anarchism-and-the-crisis-of-representation">Anarchism and the Crisis of Representation</a>, 
where he notes that "contextually speaking, Godwinâ€™s vision of the future is really a reflection of its own present, a distorted representation of 
Eisenhower-era gender codes that projects these onto the universe itself, rewriting social conventions as natural law." Cohn expands on this in his 2024 _Hot Equations_ (the title of which is a riposte to Godwin's), summarising that "If 'The Cold Equations' tends, on a deeper level, to conflate physics with politics, midcentury US gender roles with the fundamental laws of the cosmos itself, this is because the story takes part in a historic 'purification' of SF."
