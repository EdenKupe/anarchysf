One of the few explicitly anarchist SF novels. The plot is stock utopian: the protagonists escape via time machine into the future, encounter utopia, and decide to stay.
 
The future society is anarchist to a pattern apparently of Gordon's own devising. The only rules the community abide by are inscribed on a memorial stone to the instigator of the revolution:

  THE GOSPEL OF THIS COMMUNITY . . .

  THAT NO ONE SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ISSUE ORDERS . . . 

  THAT A STATE OF ANARCHY SHALL PREVAIL . . . 

  THAT FREEDOM SHALL BE UNLIMITED . . . UNCIRCUMSCRIBED BY LAW . . . UNFETTERED BY TAXATION . . .

(Consul pb edn: 194–5)

Within the anarchy, people are free to organise on non-anarchist lines if they so choose. The society has a form of scientific priesthood, which strenuously denies that it is a quasi-government.
 
For John Pilgrim, who devoted a full page of  his 1963 _Anarchy_ article to _Utopia 239_, "Basically the theme of this  book is that government is slavery, and unnecessary slavery at that, and it is  this view of the doubtful benefits that governments confer that makes science  fiction so important at a time when centralised authoritarianism is becoming  epidemic."
