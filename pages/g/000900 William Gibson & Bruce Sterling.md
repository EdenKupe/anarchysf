Included in  Killjoy's list (see bibliography) of stories that feature sympathetic  anarchist characters.

This novel is discussed over two pages in Call's 1999 'Anarchy in the Matrix: Postmodern Anarchism in the Novels of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling' (_Anarchist Studies_ 7: 99â€“117; republished as Ch. 4 of his 2003 _Postmodern Anarchism_). Call sees this "darkly disturbing" work as the literary expression of the Foucaultian concepts of discipline and panopticism: 

"Gibson and Sterling perform the admirable service of making the carceral society that we take for granted into something slightly strange, and in so doing they increase its susceptibility to analysis and critique. Our own disciplinary regimes are perhaps too familiar, too omnipresent and invisible. But when we look at the world of _The Difference Engine_, we see exactly what is wrong with discipline and Panopticism. We can then project these results forward into the twenty-first century."
