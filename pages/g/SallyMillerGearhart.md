A future of sexual apartheid, with men in the cities and  women in the hills, seen exclusively from the women's point of view; the women  have developed nebulous psi powers and communicate freely with animals and birds  as well as each other.
Â 
Widely noted as among the feminist utopias of the second  wave of the feminist movement (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/29/woman-on-the-edge-of-time-40-years-on-hope-imagining-utopia-marge-piercy"> Piercy</a>, for example). Described by <a href="biblio.htm#Red Planets">Mark  Bould</a> as a "Lesbian feminist utopia."
