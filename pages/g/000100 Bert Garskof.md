A book for older children, describing an anarchist community of the future (though the word itself isn't used). It has apparently grown out of the sixties commune movement, and seems to be a sort of hippie utopia for kids. Though stateless, Canbe has a system of local, regional, continental and general planning groups,  "the closest things the New Era had to what in the olden times were called governments" (Dandelion edn: 58); their function is to co-ordinate the work of all the various communal associations and collectives.

Tess Derbyfield, reviewing the book for _Open Road_, found the reader "taken on a fascinating tour of an anarchistic  society in full and healthy operation." "This book is a serious yet delightful  exploration of anarchist possibilities." (Derbyfield 1978)
