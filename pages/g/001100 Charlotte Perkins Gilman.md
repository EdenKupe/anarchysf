'The Yellow Wallpaper' is a powerful feminist story: a first-person account of a woman's mental health fragmenting in the face of the 'rest cure' prescribed by her patriarchal physician husband. Described by China Mi√©ville, in his 'Fifty Fantasy & Science Fiction Works That Socialists Should Read' (copied to the anarchysf mailing list in 2005) as "terrifying," and a "Towering work by this radical thinker." The story is also referenced in Jesse Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations_. In 2025 it is used as an exemplar of how patriarchy functions as a hierarchical system in literature, in Mason Carter's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hRpPvlYQ_LP71XwxiMokuYnf7KAzzhe99M2eEAY6WQw/edit?tab=t.0">The Anarchist Literary Theory & Practice</a>.

_Moving the Mountain_ depicts a short near-future (1940) socialist feminist utopian USA. Although superficially attractive, it's notable that the utopia is predicated on having first eliminated mentally ill and disabled people, and unredeemable criminals.

_Herland_ is an interesting and surprisingly readable lost-race story of  an all-woman utopia, but for Jesse Cohn, writing 99 years after its original  publication, it is "decidedly non-anarchist" (221).
