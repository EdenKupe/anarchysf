title: "Jean Grave - Les Aventures de Nono"

Grave was a notable activist in the French anarchist and international anarchist communism movements, and the editor of three major anarchist periodicals, Le Révolté, La Révolte and Les Temps Nouveaux. Among his books was this short fantasy, described in the 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary as a "libertarian utopia for children". Nettlau, in his [Esbozo](https://materialesfopep.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/max-nettlau-esbozo-de-historia-de-las-utopc3adas.pdf), notes that this was used as a second reading book in Ferrer's Modern School in Barcelona, which opened in the year of its publication.

The text itself is no longer of any great interest, however.
