_Neuromancer_ is of course a cyberpunk classic. It is among the works of Gibson and Bruce Sterling that are discussed in Call (1999 - see bibliography), for whom this novel, in a way, "represents a crucial transition point between the modern and the postmodern."

_Idoru_'s Walled City "presents us with a new model of anarchist politics, for it insists that truly radical activities cannot be carried out within the epistemological framework of modern spatial relations" (Call (1999): 105).  For Se√°n Sheehan (2003), however, "Cyberpunk is partly  characterized by neat, throw-away concepts like the Walled City, but such ideas  hardly constitute an attempt to dismantle the bourgeois forms of reality,  especially when they occur within novels like _Idoru_ that are utterly  conventional in their narrative form."

Rich Dana (Ricardo Feral) quoted from _All Tomorrow's Parties_ in his 'Feral Technology' piece for _Fifth Estate_ #405, Winter 2020.

A rather questionable link here, but <a href="http://mises.org/library/friedrich-hayek-and-american-science-fiction"> Jeff Riggenbach</a> has traced a perceived influence on _Pattern Recognition_  from the neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek.

_Distrust that Particular Flavor_ is a non-fictional collection of essays, which was <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/388-winter-2013/william-gibson-unintended-prophet-of-our-digital-future/">reviewed</a> at length by Paul J. Comeau for _Fifth Estate_ #388, Winter 2013.
