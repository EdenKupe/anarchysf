Incorporates two volumes previously published separately:  _Give Me Liberty_ (2003) and _Visions of Liberty_ (2004). The  anthologies won a Special Award from the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of  Fame Award in 2005.
 
Exceptionally  disappointing anthology on the theme of societies without government, or with  very little. Most stories are pedestrian and uninspiring, though a couple of  genre classics are included: Russell's 'And Then There Were None', and van  Vogt's 'The Weapon Shop'. Linaweaver's 'A Reception at the Anarchist Embassy' is  irritating and juvenile.
