Sir Humfrey Gylberte and other figures from the past are plunged into 1990 by a US Navy experiment. 'Humf', as he becomes, eventually throws in his lot with the lorry people, who are a sort of hippie-anarchic travelling community. This is apparently in fulfilment of the Egyptian priestess Tari's sense of their destiny. An earlier exchange with Humf had outlined this:
 
"I told you," she said patiently. "We work towards self-responsibility so that the need of hidden elite groups is reduced!"
"Spiritual socialism?" I asked bitterly.
"More precisely, it is an-archy, meaning 'without a ruler,' or perhaps I should say, 'without earthly ruler,' for it's impossible to gain such a state without some common sense of things within and beyond, through which we are, in fact and always, united." (1984 Arrow pb edn: 262)
The novel, though entertaining, is poorly unified, and it's doubtful what lessons, if any, can be drawn.
