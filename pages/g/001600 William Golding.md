Anarchist critics took a dislike to _Lord of the Flies_,  and those with a particular interest in SF were also at pains to exclude it from  the genre, as they understood it (Uloth 1961, Pilgrim 1963, A.M. 1976, A.F.  1983). For A.F. "The book is indeed a deliberately anti-humanist tract,  following Golding's frequently expressed hatred of science and progress, and  also an equally anti-anarchist tract, insisting that humanity without law and  authority must relapse into savagery." In 2020
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/"> Zeke Teflon</a> described the book as "disgusting, [and] discredited."
 
A.F. considered Golding's second novel, _The Inheritors_, to be his best.
