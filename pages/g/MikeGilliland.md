title: "Mike Gilliland - The Free"
---

Described by its publisher as "A novel of love, hope and revolution, set in the very near future, on an island off the coast of Britain. From the underground to revolution, repression and resistance! Essential. The first great contemporary anarchist novel." Frank Jackson, in a 1986 review in the   New Anarchist Review, found it "A raw visionary book that touches a  hopeful chord."
 
There is an  online essay entitled "What can M.  Gilliland's The Free contribute to an understanding of the conceptual  structure of modern British class struggle anarchism?" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/1346/pThefreehtml.htm"> here</a>. See also Cohn: 201-2, 223.
 
The author says the later editions are "3 times as long and 10 times better, with lots more humour, sex and  triumphing alternatives". In his list of the novel's themes (at the end of  the text) he says "The Free are inspired by the anarchist fiesta, trying out  Pete Kropotkin's cut on Darwin. Cooperation in tooth and claw."
 
The Free gives an exceptionally vivid  account of the exhilaration of the revolutionary process, with strongly imagined  characters and very believable dialogue. Potentially inspirational.
