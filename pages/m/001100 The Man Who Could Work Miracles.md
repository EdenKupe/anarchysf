Adaptation of the H.G. Wells story, on which Wells  himself, worked, revising the plot to reflect his socialist frustrations with  the British upper class, and the growing threat from extremism in Europe.

Mark Bould's 2005 _Socialist Review_ article, copied  to the Anarchy-SF mailing list, described the film as "pretty good".
