Gothic dark fantasy, catalogued as science fiction by [CIRA](http://www.cira.ch/catalogue/index.php?lvl=categ_see&id=346&page=2&nbr_lignes=84&main=&l_typdoc=g,i,a,l), but barely justifiably, presumably based on its far-future post-civilisation setting. Though the author is said to be a member of the anarchist writers&#39; bloc in Montreal [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027135541/anarchy101.org/4872/what-is-your-favorite-anarchist-novel">Anarchy 101 Q&A</a>], and the book apparently has the imprimatur of John Zerzan and others [<a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Necropolis-Bruno-Massé-ebook/dp/B00HLSGO7M/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=massé+necropolis&qid=1560454316&s=gateway&sr=8-1">Amazon</a>], there is nothing particularly anarchist about it, and the writing is dire. Not recommended.
