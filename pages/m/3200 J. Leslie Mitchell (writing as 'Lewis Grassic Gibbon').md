"A transatlantic airship goes through a timewarp and crashes into a mountain of Atlantis. The three survivors are found by a tribe of Basque-speaking Cro-Magnons, whose society has no government, property, war, superstition, clothing, or other vices of civilization." (Dan Clore)
 
Surprisingly effective, and Mitchell's  portrayal of the Cro-Magnon society is sympathetic and passionate.
