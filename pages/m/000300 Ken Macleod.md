Distinctive left-wing Scottish take on sf, displaying evidence of the author's own activism.
 
"Portrays a future that includes both a libertarian socialist society and a libertarian capitalist society." (Dan Clore)
  
. . . "while both anarcho-communist and  anarcho-capitalist worlds have appeared in science fiction, only The Cassini  Division shows them making contact and slowly starting to subvert each  other." (<a href="http://reason.com/archives/2000/11/01/anarchies-states-and-utopias">Walker</a>)
 
In March 2011 Macleod published a review of a new interpretation of the work and  influence of the individualist Max Stirner, in issue 1 of the new journal  i.
 
The Star Fraction, The Stone Canal, and Learning the World were Prometheus  Award winners. <a href="http://libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/persp/persp010.pdf"> Macleod</a> has described Star Fraction as "a libertarian novel about  communists," and Stone Canal as "a communist novel about libertarians".
 
All except Newton's Wake  and Learning the World are  included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>. Newton's Wake is  recommended on a relevant <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/256904/No-More-Culture-Books-left-what-other-SF-is-like-Iain-Banks"> Ask Metafilter</a> page, and is included in LibraryThing's <a href="http://www.librarything.com/tag/anarchism,+science+fiction">anarchism,  science fiction</a> tagmash.
 
The Night Sessions is in a different  vein from the others, an sf/crime fiction hybrid, set in a secularist world in  which faith-heads are a mistrusted minority, and all flavours of fundamentalism  equally abhorred.
 
In Macleod's 2002 <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/f0c74f_a5e27cce5f504aaea74c0c7f38946ff6.pdf"> article</a> on 'Anarchism and Science Fiction' he notes that, after being  introduced to anarchism in his youth, . . . off I went and read all I could find about Anarchism, starting with Giovanni Baldelli’s Social Anarchism, April Carter’s The Political Theory of Anarchism, and the Cohn-Bendits’ Obsolete Communism. They didn’t make me an Anarchist, but they changed my life. By way of retaliation, I’d like to get more Anarchists interested in science fiction, and change theirs.
What I’d like to see is not just more SF informed by Anarchism, but an Anarchist movement and climate of opinion much more informed by SF than it currently is.

In the same article he stated that he couldn't have written The Star Fraction without Nozack's Anarchy, State and Utopia, or The Sky Road without Gambone's Proudhon and Anarchism. Elsewhere he said that Star Fraction also owed a debt to Rothbard's For a New Liberty, and Stone Canal to Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom.

Farah Mendlesohn's 'Impermanent Revolution: The Anarchic Utopias of Ken MacLeod', in her Rejected Essays and Buried Thoughts, considers Macleod's 'Fall Revolution' series (the first four novels above) at some length. She argues that "Each of MacLeod’s utopias is built upon a different anarchist theory." In summary:

The Fall Revolution Quartet tries to show how a viable anarchy might function, but unlike many utopian authors MacLeod is anxious to provide a choice of models: this multiplicity of models is in itself crucial to any anarchist project. To insist on only one model, only one truth for utopia, would be to revert to ideological authoritarianism. MacLeod outlines for us four potential or actual utopias: a Trotskyite utopia (which never comes to pass and which I will not be considering here) in The Star Fraction, a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist society in both isolated and universalist form in The Stone Canal, a socialist Stirnerite anarchy in The Cassini Division, and in The Sky Road, an ecotopia which may or may not be anarchic or libertarian, depending on one’s definition. The common threads between the three established utopias are the rejection of the state as the primary means of organisation, and the assertion of utopia as a necessarily civilised and technological project, rather than as a retreat to primitivism.

Intrusion is a sort of low-key dystopia set in a New Labour inspired surveillance society and nanny state, in which a pregnant mother resists pressure to conform by taking 'the fix', a pill that corrects defects lurking in the child's genome. Cory Doctorow's boingboing review says "MacLeod himself is a Marxist who is lauded by libertarians, and his unique perspective, combined with a flair for storytelling, yields up a haunting, gripping story of resistance, terror, and an all-consuming state that commits its atrocities with the best of intentions." The novel is "highly recommended" by Zeke Teflon, for whom this is "the best near-future dystopian sci-fi novel that’s appeared in years." Teflon, however, is annoyed by MacLeod's "impenetrable Britishisms and (is this even a word?) Scottishisms"; this side of the Atlantic MacLeod's uncompromising use of the language is refreshing.

The Human Front Plus is one of the PM Press short books coupling a title novella with a short or an essay, an author interview, and a bibliography. In this case the novella is an entertaining alternate history. In the interview (with Terry Bisson), when asked whether he would describe himself as a libertarian, Macleod replied ". . . I don't call myself a Libertarian, in the sense of a supporter of the Libertarian Party or anything like that. My usual handwave for my position is "hard-left libertarian" but in practice I just vote Labour."

The Corporation Wars: Dissidence is the first book of a hard SF trilogy centring on sentient robots, dead soldiers digitally reincarnated, and complex worlds of simulation, engaged in megacorporate combat. Again, favourably reviewed by [Teflon](https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/the-corporation-wars-dissidence-by-ken-macleod/), for whom it is "highly recommended." Teflon also recommends the second book, The Corporation Wars: Insurgence.
