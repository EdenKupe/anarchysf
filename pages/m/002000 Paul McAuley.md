_Red Dust_ is a complex novel set on a Chinese-run  Mars where terraforming is failing fast. One character is consistently referred  to as an anarchist, but little is made of this, the label apparently chiefly  intended to evoke the exotic.

The _Quiet War_ sequence concerns tensions between Earth and  the outer planets. The second novel follows on directly from the first.

For a 2009 poster to the anarchysf mailing list, "The  Outers have variants of Libertarian societies while Earth is ruled by the  Oligarchies." Included in the Sharp and Pointed list of <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/tag/anarchist-science-fiction/"> essential novels of anarchist science fiction</a>, the two books,  while "antiauthoritarian but not anarchist",  "concern the brutal aggression of the authoritarian empires that emerged from  the chaos against the in-some-ways anarchistic “Outers” who have colonized the  moons of Jupiter and Saturn."
