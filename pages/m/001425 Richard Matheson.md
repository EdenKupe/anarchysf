Surprisingly good, despite the improbable premise. <a href="https://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/richard-matheson-the-shrinking-man-1956/">Evan Lampe</a> has an entry on this novel, of which he says "it is an interesting meditation on human vulnerability, freedom, and how our outward appearance shaped our place in our communities. These are all useful themes for left-libertarians to meditate on."
