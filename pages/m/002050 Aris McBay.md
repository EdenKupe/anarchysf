Resistance to the invasion of an inverted pocket universe. Described in a <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/jake-casella-brookins-reviews-inversion-by-aric-mcbay/">_Locus_</a> review as "in the tradition of utopian and anarchist science fiction". The reviewer rightly notes, though, that it's the kind of utopia that's literally impossible for us to get to.
