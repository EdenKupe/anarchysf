title: "Louise Michel - The  Human Microbes  (1886); The New World"
---

Among the literary works of the French anarchist Louise  Michel is The Human Microbes, described by Santo Catanuto as "a Jules Verne-style 'science  fiction' novel". (Catanuto: 30) An English translation by Brian Stableford was  published in 2012, and it now appears that Catanuto's description is wide of the  mark. It is in fact a lurid short novel, written while Michel was in solitary  confinement in prison, described in the blurb as "like Eugène Sue on speed". Not  itself SF at all, it was planned as the first of a six-novel series, of which  only one further novel appeared—The New World (also translated by  Stableford and published in 2012; there is a passing mention of Bakunin); it  seems that the series, as projected, would have developed to depict not just the  worldwide transformation of Earth but an expansion to other worlds, which in  Stableford's words "would indeed have made it an unparalleled epic of anarchist  scientific romance." (introduction to the Black Coat Press edition). Both  novels are referred to in the 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary.
