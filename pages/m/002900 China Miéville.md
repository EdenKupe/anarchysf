_Perdido Street Station_ and _Iron Council_ were recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel "Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction" at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009. _Iron Council_ was reviewed by <a href="https://anarchism.pageabode.com/blog/ultra-leftism-market-socialism-and-inequality/">Anarcho</a>, at Anarchist Writers, who was put off by the author's SWP credentials, but nevertheless found it "a reasonably interesting book written by someone with real imagination." Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations_ has a page on _Perdido Street Station_.

_The Scar_ has been recommended on  the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/search/?query=the scar"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>. While I would endorse the  recommendation—the floating pirate city of Armada is particularly  attractive—this, along with Miéville's two other New Crobuzon books, are aptly  described as 'New Weird', and not easily categorised as sf.

_Un Lun Dun_ was also recommended at the Seattle Bookfair, but it is young adult urban fantasy, not sf.

_The City and the City_ is  included in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.

_Embassytown_ is included in David Agranoff's list of "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2167338-david-agranoff?shelf=anarchist-themed-sci-fi">anarchist-themed-sci-fi</a>".  It's also suggested on the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/search/?query=embassytown"> Anarchism and Science Fiction forum</a>, and mentioned briefly in the Winter 2013 issue of _Organise!_

_The Last Days of New Paris_ is an alternate history novella in which surrealist imagery from our own reality has been actualised. It was reviewed at length at <a href="http://www.redwedgemagazine.com/online-issue/the-last-days">Red Wedge</a>.

Miéville is a Marxist, and a member of the Socialist Workers Party.
