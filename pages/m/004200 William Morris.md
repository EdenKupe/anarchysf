In 1886 Morris invited Kropotkin, whom he had recently met, and liked immediately, to write for his paper,  _The Commonweal_, but he declined. It was probably through Morris's early contact with Kropotkin, though, that the Commonweal press facilities were used to print _Freedom_. That year, in a letter, he spoke of  "us semi-anarchists", which is really as close to anarchism as Morris ever admitted to (Mackail 11:149). In a letter the following year, he wrote:  "I distinctly disagree with the Anarchist principle, much as I sympathise with many of the anarchists personally, and although I have an Englishman's wholesome horror of government interference and centralisation . . ." (Morris 1951:5). In  'Socialism and Anarchism', a letter in _Commonweal_ on 5th May 1889, Morris wrote:  "I will begin by saying that I call myself a Communist, and have no wish to  qualify that word by joining any other to it." Ruth Kinna's 2000 _William Morris: The Art of Socialism_ gives a really clear account of the development of Morris's thought in the context of the socialist trends of the time, in which he had in fact formed his own interpretation of what it meant to be a communist.

He himself was always well-liked by anarchists. An anonymous commentator in _Freedom_ in 1891 observed that  "Like other people, Anarchists admire his artistic genius, but, in addition,  there is not an Anarchist worth his salt who, being acquainted with William  Morris, does not respect him as a good comrade and an honest man."

<em>News from Nowhere</em>—"A vision rather than a dream" of a utopian future—was written as a libertarian response to Bellamy's _Looking Backward_. The polity is described as communist throughout, as one would expect, but the vision parallels closely many people's notions of an ideal anarchist society. No attempt to précis the book could possibly do it justice. Perhaps a single clue to its appeal might be found in Chapter XIII,  'Concerning Politics'—which is just twelve lines long, "because we have none."

Anarchists have generally taken Morris's tale to their hearts. For an anonymous _Freedom_ writer of 1891,  "Comrade Morris is not avowedly an Anarchist by conviction; but in character he is a born-Anarchist, and in very much of his writing—for instance, News from Nowhere—the most hypercritical of Anarchists would have to borrow a pair of spectacles to discover serious points of disagreement." Peter Kropotkin, in his 1896 memorial to Morris, described _News from Nowhere_ as  "perhaps the most thoroughly and deeply Anarchistic conception of future society that has ever been written. . . . his ideal society is undoubtedly the one which is most free of all our State and monastic traditions; the most imbued with the feelings of equality and humanitarian love; the most spontaneously growing out of a spirit of free understanding."(109) George Woodcock felt that the society portrayed by Morris was one "with which Godwin could have found no fault" [Read 1946: 253]. Much later Jeff Cloves, in _Freedom_ in 1968, summed up the feelings of many:  "I'm not bothered by jeers about the impracticality and implausibility of News from Nowhere. All that I know is that when I read it, I think . . . that's what I want, that's how life ought to be."  Murray Bookchin, in his _The Ecology of Freedom_, refers to Morris as "my favorite utopian".

Ruth Kinna's judgment on the novel is that "Morris's aim was not to show how the good society should be organized, but to show how good society could be if the barriers to freedom and fellowship were removed." (p216)

In November 2021 <a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-iii-on-the-shores-of-communist-h-e-avens/">Javier Saithness</a> wrote that "Although this novella depicts communist h(e)avens, it may more accurately be classified as an anti-modern utopia integrating Romantic, pastoral, and even proto-solarpunk themes." In his view "The importance of Morris' Romantic-revolutionary outlook should not be underestimated. All of it remains relevant today."

W.D. James, in a November 2023 <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/william-morris-dreaming-of-justice-and-of-home-egalitarian-anti-modernism-part-6/">article</a> reproduced at the Online Anarchist Federation, from <a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/2023/11/28/william-morris-dreaming-of-justice-and-of-home-egalitarian-anti-modernism-part-6/">organic radicals</a>, discusses this work, but takes the less conventional view (among anarchists): "I have to confess that I do not really like this book. It doesn’t have a very sophisticated understanding of human psychology and, hence, I can't really see any society, even a utopian one, working as Morris presents it. It just doesn't 'work'; or 'hang together'; for me."

In October 2024, writing in _Graswurzelrevolution_, Maurice Schuhmann pronounced that "The genre of 'anarchistic science fiction' begins with this novel." ["Mit diesem Roman beginnt letztendlich das Genre der „anarchistischen Science Fiction“."]

As a corrective, it should be noted that Michael Holzman, in his '<a href="https://morrisarchive.lib.uiowa.edu/items/show/981">Anarchism and Utopia: William Morris's <em>News from Nowhere</em></a>, has concluded that "the episodes and speeches of <em>News from Nowhere </em>were in themselves political acts, a last-ditch effort against the Anarchists who were seizing control of Morris's Socialist League, an apologia for a vision of the world as it might be, a plan for action that was not followed."

With _The Dispossessed_, _News from Nowhere_ ranks as one of the two essential texts in the context of this guide.

In the  lightweight satirical playlet _The Tables Turned_, "the sleeper who awakes in a libertarian-socialist society in Part II is the corrupt judge who presides over the farcical trial of socialists and anarchists in Part I." (The pre-revolution  Part 1 is much the longer of the two parts.) "There, he has to face the Council of the Commune (the general assembly of the local population, or folk-mote), who refuse to waste chains by shackling him, or to take care of him in a prison (they have none, anyway), but instead teach him to do useful work farming so that he might become a self-employed individual like everyone else."
