In _Three Go Back_ "A transatlantic airship goes through a timewarp and crashes into a mountain of Atlantis. The three survivors are found by a tribe of Basque-speaking Cro-Magnons, whose society has no government, property, war, superstition, clothing, or other vices of civilization." (Dan Clore) The novel is surprisingly effective, and Mitchell's portrayal of the Cro-Magnon society is sympathetic and passionate.

In _Gay Hunter_ the eponymous protagonist is swept 20,000 years into the future for a few weeks, revelling in post-civilisational primitivism.

William K. Malcolm, in Klaus and Knight, eds: _'To Hell with Culture'_, devotes a chapter to Mitchell, who is quoted as saying "I am a Scotsman, an artist, and—an integral part of my being—an anarchist. My art is implicit anarchy." Specifically, Mitchell also referred to himself as a "good anarcho-communist." Later, though, he recalled: "So I went Anarchist for a bit, but they're such damn fools, with their blah about Kropotkin (whose anthropology is worse than Frazer's) and Bakunin." Nonetheless, for Malcolm, "His utopian political ideal portraying a free and just society is anarchist in conception, predicated, very like Kropotkin's, on a belief in natural human values and instincts." He speaks disparagingly, though of Mitchell's sf:

"Put simply, his weakest writing—the rather glib fantasy and magic realism of his story cycles and of the pulp novels _Three Go Back, The Lost Trumpet_ and _Gay Hunter_  —involved the direct depiction of [ . . . ] an anarchist utopia happily stripped of the maladies of modern civilization—but thereby also divorced from the frantic social concerns of life in the twentieth century."
