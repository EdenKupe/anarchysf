Superlative post-apocalyptic novel, but Jesse Cohn sees it  as one of a number of scenarios of disaster substituting for popular radical  narratives in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis (391). Leona, in _The BASTARD Chronicles 2015_, similarly includes _The Road_ among her  examples of "the embrace of hopelessness and alienation" that we should be wary of.

<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/">Teflon</a> comments on this novel that its "premise is so absurd (all life on earth extinguished except for humans) that the book should be dismissed out of hand. (Of course, McCarthy is an acclaimed 'literary' author, so, at least in academic eyes, he deserves to be taken seriously — as should the postmodernist b.s. artists.)
