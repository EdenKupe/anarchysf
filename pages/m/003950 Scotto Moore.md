Overly-complicated narrative depending too much on gaming, but readable enough. Part of the storyline involves an anarchist resistance. Anarchism doesn't, however, feature heavily, although at one point a character sneaks in a quick plug, almost as subliminal propaganda:

"Look, people think anarchists just want to tear down the world order out of spite or because they prefer chaos for aesthetic reasons. That's exactly what the oligarchic media machine wants the masses to believeâ€”that anarchists are dangerous and immoral and out of control. The oligarchs don't want people imagining a world order where they're not trapped at the bottom of the pile, where they're more than just cogs generating wealth they don't get to share.

"But anarchy really means you allow people to self-organize, instead of letting dictator-presidents and corporations rule by fiat. Anarchy means you volunteer to live in a network of empowered communities instead of just passively accepting a militarized police state as the default. Anarchy means you look out for the people around you instead of counting on some inevitably corrupt, top-down system of government to catch everyone who falls on hard times." [p175]
