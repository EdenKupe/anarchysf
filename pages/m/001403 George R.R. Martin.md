Fix-up about the problem-solving exploits of an ecological engineer with his vast millennia-old starship, a relic of a long-gone galactic empire, containing a multi-species cell library and extensive facilities for cloning and genetic 
engineering.

The book was recommended by Zeke Teflon, in an intelligent <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/book-review-tuf-voyaging/">review</a> in which he describes it as "a social science fiction tale focusing 
on the perils of runaway population growth and religious dogmatism," concluding that "those happy with a simple but amusing tall tale, with a social/political message with which theyâ€™ll probably agree (any sane person would), will enjoy 
the book."
