Second film version of the Richard Condon novel; political  thriller about Gulf War veterans with implanted nanotech command devices that  will oblige them to kill when prompted, with one of the vets intended for a  presidential assassin.

Tom Jennings found it an "effective" update, with the  revisions "appropriate", but felt it had lost "much  of the political sharpness of the source novel".
