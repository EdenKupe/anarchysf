It's a bit of a stretch to regard this as science fiction,  but I'm happy to count it as such on the strength of its inclusion in Bould's _Red Planets_ filmography, where it's  described as a "Comedy about the absurdity of ultramodernity." It's a delightful  light comedy, and beautifully observed, having a gentle dig at consumerism, and  suggesting that there might be more important values than materialism.
