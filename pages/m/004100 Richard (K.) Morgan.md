_Altered Carbon_, _Broken Angels_, and _Woken Furies_ together constitute a trilogy described by <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a> as having "distinct anarchist undertones". Clinton Fry, on  the Facebook Anarchists and Science Fiction page, wrote that _Woken Furies_ "is  about as good as sci fi gets. There are good bits in there about the nature of  power, anarchism, the inherent failures of central planning technocracy....lots  of good stuff."

_Market Forces_ is "An overtly  political projection of the future of corporate capitalism." (<a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">Teflon</a>)  For Bork, on FB Anarchists and Science Fiction, this is one of two books by Morgan that "play with  some interesting concepts for anarchists". For Wally Conger, who includes this  novel in his <a href="http://wconger.liberty.me/2014/08/10/top-10-sci-fi-liberty-novels-you-probably-havent-read/">
Top Ten Sci-Fi Liberty Novels</a>, "all Libertarian Leftists—whether  agorist, georgist, mutualist, or other—should thoroughly enjoy this brutal and  extraordinarily well-written page-turner."

_Black Man_ is highly recommended by Zeke <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a>, who describes it as "A very dystopian look at a future theofascist  USA." 

_Thin Air_ is described by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2018/12/22/review-thin-air-by-richard-k-morgan/">Teflon</a> as "set on a very dystopian Mars a couple of centuries hence," and "a commentary on the results of colonialism in a neo-liberal context", with an intricate plot in which "every single corporate, political and governmental entity is corrupt and treacherous." For him this too is highly recommended.
