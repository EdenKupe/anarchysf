Set in an alternate, 21st-century New York City rebranded as New Rome, the film follows a visionary architect as he clashes with the corrupt mayor, who opposes his plans to revitalize New Rome by building the utopian Megalopolis.

Coppola claimed to have been strongly influenced, in its making, by four books, of which three were by David Graeber. This in turn prompted Simoun Magsalin to write a long <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/2024/10/06/searching-for-utopia-in-megalopolis/">review article</a> for _Freedom News_, seeking to discern where the influence lies. Magsalin notes that "Graeberâ€™s vision of an alternative world is certainly a theme in the film. The film even ends with a pledge to humanity, after all. But Graeber's analytical method is one precisely not rooted in utopianism but _materialism_." The reviewer acknowledges that "It's clear that _Megalopolis_ does try to impart something Graeberian in its viewers. The pledge to humanity at the end imparts a kind of common loyalty to humanity that implies a certain treachery to nation-states and Empire"; but the message is undermined by Coppola's failure to see the hypocrisy in the building of Megalopolis necessarily destroying swathes of working-class housing. Magsalin concludes that "I think _Megalopolis_ speaks to the idea that social renewal relies on 
great men like Cesar, great technologies like Megalon, and great visions like Megalopolis. This reflects a largely liberal world-view that eschews revolution and revolutionary change. This is, perhaps, not surprising given the class conditions of its director-writer-producer."
