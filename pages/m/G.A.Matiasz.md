A near future  (2007) in which war and civil war rage across the former Soviet Union and much  of the globe. Prosperous, competing regional capitalist blocs have been  consolidated in Europe, North America and East Asia under transnational  corporate leadership. The US is fighting a sophisticated, high-tech  counterinsurgency war in southern Mexico, against a popular libertarian  revolution claiming the tradition of Zapata. A military draft has been  reinstated, and a strong antiwar movement flourishes on American streets. In a  small town north of San Francisco a group of antiwar college students gains  possession of enough bomb-grade riemanium to build a nuclear weapon, and Oakland  rises in revolution to become the 21st century's Paris Commune.

Described by Hakim Bey as "a very smart  meditation on the near-future of anarchism" (blurb), Randall Barnhart, reviewing  the book on Amazon.com, commented: "Yup, this is the greatest piece of anarchist agit-prop since . . . well, since forever. There is nothing better." In the same  place Britt A. Green summed it up as  "Well-thought out, anarchist, sci-fi."
