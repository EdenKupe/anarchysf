Cyberpunk satire on network news, featuring a  computer-generated host. Episode 8, 'War', centres on a terrorist group called  the 'White Brigade' dedicated to "neo-radicalistic anarcho-syndicalism"; their  fanatical leader is actually in a commercial relationship with one of the TV  news networks.

Bould's _Red Planets_ encapsulates the production as a "Punky dystopian drama later sanitised as a US  primetime series."
