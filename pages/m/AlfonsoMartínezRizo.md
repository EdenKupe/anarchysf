title: "Alfonso Martínez Rizo - 1945. El advenimiento del comunismo libertario. Una  vision
  novelesca del porvenir"
---

Spanish anarchist utopia, set in what was just thirteen years in the future at  the time of writing. <a href="https://publish.lib.umd.edu/scifi/article/view/278/41">Rodriquez</a>  gives the following summary:
  
 This  short political novel narrates the peaceful triumph of libertarian communism in  Spain following a general strike declared by anarcho-syndicalist unions, which  represent most of the population, thus expanding the already large base of  Spanish anarchists at that time. Money, private property, and all prior  institutions are peacefully extinguished as anarchist unions take over their  functions.
  
 Martínez Rizo was vice-president of the CNT's Sindicato de Obreros Intelectuales  in Barcelona, and his familiarity with the CNT and FAI is clear in his  first-person utopia. Jesse Cohn's Underground  Passages has a few pages on this work, noting the author's attention to  what he calls the 'moral' process of emancipation, which takes place at  different rates for different people, as well as his use of language which he  finds "remarkably similar to the kind of linguistic transformation Orwell  witnessed in the freshly liberated Barcelona" of 1936.
  
 The text is available in Spanish in  Volume II of the 1991 three-volume Ediciones Tuero publication of Utopías  Libertarias; Vol. II is entitled II. Utopías Libertarias Españolas,  siglos XIX-XX.
