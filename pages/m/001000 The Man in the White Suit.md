Ealing comedy in which a research scientist invents an indestructible  dirt-repellent fabric, but wealthy mill owners and trade unions try to suppress  the invention.

Included in the <a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/F/Fahrenheit-451-1966-.html">Libertarian  Movies</a> filmography. For Osborne (see bibliography), this was  one of the few selections in his guide "to receive the perfect 'double-five'  scoreâ€”that is, dead-on libertarian content and first-rate production  quality/entertainment value."
