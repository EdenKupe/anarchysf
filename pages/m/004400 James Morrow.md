_City of Truth_ starts as a genuinely funny satire (perhaps reminiscent of Samuel Butler) predicated on a society in which the ability to tell untruths is forcibly conditioned out of you in childhood; but the novella switches mood to a more sentimental reflection on the value of white lies. Zeke Teflon's perceptive <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/03/06/a-neglected-though-flawed-sci-fi-gem-city-of-truth/">review</a> finds it "Recommended, despite its flaws."

_Towing Jehovah_ is a satirical look at the improbable claims of religion,  centring on the death of God as a literal event, with his corpse found floating  in the Atlantic. Affectionately irreverent, the novel was much appreciated by Tom Flynn, in <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/tom_flynn_-_science_fiction_and_atheism/"> Science Fiction and Atheism</a>.
