. . . "a stateless community wages a non-violent war against invaders" . . . (Cohn: 119).  San Francisco, after a plague, is inhabited by artists, who actively and  successfully resist an attempt to re-establish governmental order, using  creative means that minimise (but don't eliminate) personal violence.
 
'How I Spent My Summer Vacation' is the final  story in the themed _Time Gate_ anthology, edited by Robert Silverberg with  Bill Fawcett; the liberated simulacrum of Mikhail Bakunin (from the earlier  Sheckley story) reappears in friendly conversation with Queen Victoria, and is  later contemplating his potential future as an anarchist computer virus.
