Superlative post-apocalyptic novel, but Jesse Cohn sees it  as one of a number of scenarios of disaster substituting for popular radical  narratives in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis (391). Leona, in The BASTARD Chronicles 2015, similarly includes The Road among her  examples of "the embrace of hopelessness and alienation" that we should be wary  of.
