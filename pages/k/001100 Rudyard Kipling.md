"Effective but reactionary" . . . (Moorcock 1978)
 
The first story introduced the Aerial Board  of Control, and is an air drama followed by long magazine extracts; it is highly  realistic, and first-rate early sf. It's also superior to its sequel, in which  the ABC are called in to suppress mob-making in Chicago.
