title: "Nancy Kress - Beggars in Spain (1993);  'Migration'"
---

Beggars in Spain is included in Think Galactic's <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.
 
In 'Migration', a libertarian planet, imaginatively called Freedom, is the  only place where gene modification is allowed; the story features animal  liberation. Thanks to Lise Andreasen for suggesting this  one.
