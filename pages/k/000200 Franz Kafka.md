'Metamorphosis' describes a worker who wakes up to find he's become an insect. In 2025 _Freedom News_ reprinted an article by the director of a Greek dramatisation of this famous fable, on <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/04/06/kafka-in-the-21st-century/">Kafka in the 21st Century</a>. Tasos Sagris concludes "A hundred years after Kafka's death, our performance has shown that the great Czech author remains more 
relevant than ever. As the world becomes increasingly Kafkaesque, as power structures grow stronger, individuals search for ways to escape through the cracks of the world like frightened cockroaches. And yet, at the same time, humanity continues to carry within it the possibility of radical transformation — the power of total liberation."

'In the Penal Colony' features a macabre execution machine which incises the nature of the crime into the victim's body. Michael Löwy, in his '[Franz Kafka and Libertarian Socialism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michael-lowy-franz-kafka-and-libertarian-socialism)', finds that "There are few texts in universal literature which present authority with such an unjust and murderous face."

*The Trial*—Kafka's best-known novel—isn't obviously science fiction, but Kafka's influence is sufficiently pervasive that John Clute has a long entry on him at [SFE](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/kafka_franz), concluding that "His work is a Baedeker to where we live now."

Current anarchist writers are clearly familiar with _The Trial_: David Graeber, for instance, sees it as paradigmatic of all great literature on bureaucracy, in taking the form of horror-comedy (p53, where _The Castle_ is seen in the same light); while for Saul Newman "Kafka's _The Trial_ might be understood in part as a meditation on voluntary servitude: rather than escaping the clasp of the law, which does not forcibly entrap him—on the contrary, it tries to repel and elude him—Joseph K persistently seeks his place within it, and in doing so constitutes the law's domination over him." (p145). (See bibliography for Graeber and Newman; see also [Tulley](https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/anarchiststudies26.2_03tulley.pdf).)

George Woodcock, in his 1948 _The Writer and Politics_, had a chapter comparing Kafka with Rex Warner, in which he favours the latter. His critique of _The Castle_ for its pessimism, though, may be unduly negative given that the novel was unfinished. For Costas Despiniadis, in his _The Anatomist of Power. Franz Kafka and the Critique of Authority_ (2019), "In _The Castle_, that symbol of absolute totalitarian authority, [Kafka] singularly describes power existing on its own, as an end in itself for its enforcers."

Kafka himself was evidently familiar with anarchism and anarchists, though the extent of his interest and degree of his activity have been contested. A decent account is given by [Löwy](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michael-lowy-franz-kafka-and-libertarian-socialism), concluding that "With his libertarian sensibility, Kafka has succeeded marvellously in capturing the oppressive and absurd nature of the bureaucratic nightmare, the opacity, the impenetrable and incomprehensible character of the rules of the state hierarchy as they are seen from below and the outside."

The fullest treatment is now that of Costas Despiniadis, in the work cited above. This short book is an explicitly anarchist interpretation of Kafka and his work, and in particular leaves no doubt about Kafka's personal involvement in anarchist circles in Prague, from 1909 to 1912. Although not prominent as an activist, he participated in the Prague anarchist group the 'Young People's Club', and was once arrested and fined for his participation in a protest against the execution of an anarchist in France. He was also well-grounded in anarchist literature, having read Godwin, Proudhon, Stirner, Goldman, Élisée Reclus, and others. The anti-authoritarianism is clear, in all his writings.
