This famous story is written as the diary of Charlie  Gordon, the subject of an experiment in which his IQ of 68 is trebled, but  subsequently declines again. It was praised by John Pilgrim for its concern for the human  condition. (Pilgrim 1963)

Novelised under the same title in 1966, Eden Kupermintz, on one of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Random-acts-of-senseless-violence---The-center-can-not-hold-eh8euj">anarchySF</a> podcasts, finds it "phenomenal", but also "one of the most depressing books you will ever read."
