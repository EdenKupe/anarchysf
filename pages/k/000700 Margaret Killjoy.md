<a href="http://www.tangledwilderness.org/a-country-of-ghosts/">_A Country of Ghosts_</a> isn't sf, but Killjoy's contemporary take on an anarchist  utopia has to be welcomed here. For Nick Mamatas, in _The BASTARD Chronicles  2015_, the book is "pretty interesting", but gets "really good" in the final  third, when war comes to the stateless utopia. The book was filmed in 2019 as _Hron: A Country of Ghosts,_ but apart from a few screenings doesn't seem to have been more widely released, although a short trailer is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z8ya0Wy7K8">online</a>.

_The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion_ is also more a  gothic fantasy novella, but anarchists and anarchism are central to the story.

_We Won't Be Here Tomorrow_ is Killjoy's first short story collection, mostly gothic/horror, but some sf, and some anarchist interest.
