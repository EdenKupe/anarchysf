 <a href="https://libcom.org/files/Rad%20America%20V3%20I4.pdf">Arthur Maglin</a>  contrasted _Not This August_ with _The Syndic_, finding the former  "reactionary" and tainted by "race prejudice and fear of communism", while the  latter "outlines a working, socialistic society".

Moorcock has a soft spot for Kornbluth, who "to my mind  had a stronger political conscience than he allowed himself, so that his stories  are sometimes confused as he tried to mesh middle-American ideas with his own  radicalism. One of my favourites (though structurally it is a bit weak) is _The Syndic_ . . ." (Moorcock 1978)

The novel is set in a future USA now ruled  jointly by the Mob and the Syndic (i.e. the Mafia), and the Government of North  America, so-called, is now no more than a pirate band making sporadic raids from  western Ireland. Government is attacked in scathing terms: one of the Syndic  chiefs says:

"Let me point out what the so-called Government stands  for: brutal 'taxation,' extirpation of gambling, denial of life's simple  pleasures to the poor and severe limitation of them to all but the wealthy,  sexual prudery viciously enforced by penal laws of appalling barbarity, endless  regulation and coercion governing every waking minute of the day. That was its  record during the days of its power and that would be its record if it is  returned to power" (Sphere edn: 39).

_The Syndic_ insists that it is not itself a government, but  it's hard to see what else it isâ€”this is the weakness of the book: the attack  on government is serious, but only a comic Mafia is put in its place.

Tied for the 1986 Libertarian Futurist  Society Hall of Fame Award.
