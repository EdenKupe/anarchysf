This is simply an old-fashioned utopia, with much  emphasis on an entire language constructed by the author. In Prashad there is no  institutionalised government or religion, no police or criminal law, no formal  authority of any kind; there is, however, much emphasis on the family as the  base element of their society, 'family' being interpreted loosely. The only  accepted rule of behaviour is that if you see something that needs doing, you do  it. The utopia of Prashad, in other words, is essentially anarchic.

Although it has twice been published in an SF  context, this story is itself not really sf.
