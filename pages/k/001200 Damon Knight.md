In 'Rule Golden' an envoy from the galactic community converts Earth to nonviolence by means of a chemical agent that causes pain to be felt by the perpetrator as much as by the victim of a violent act. The alien  spells out how governments exist for war, and how nothing they do could not be  done without them. "Government," it says, "builds nothing but more government."  (1975 Pan edn of _Natural State and other Stories_: 70) Since "all governments were based on violence, as currency was based on metal," (68-9) all the world's governments in due course collapse.

_The Futurians_ is Knight's non-fiction memoir on the early and influential fan/writer/editor grouping that adopted that name. While they're seen as largely left-wing, Rich Dana, writing in _Fifth Estate_ in 2019, noted that their number also included a James Blish who flirted with a theoretical technocracy the Futurians regarded as 'paper fascism'. Dana calls Knight's memoir "definitive."
