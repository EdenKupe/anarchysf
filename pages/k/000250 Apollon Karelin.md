Described at <a href="https://ttolk-ru.translate.goog/?p=24774&_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB">Russian anarchist utopias of the 1920s</a> as "a classic utopia, despite a rather complex composition: the hero listens to the story of his friend, who dreams of the future, but this is not a story, but a retelling of an article from a magazine in which two English travellers talk about their visit to the country of anarchists."

Published (legally) by the All-Russian Federation of Anarchists.
