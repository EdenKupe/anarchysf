A fascinating collection of interviews with anarchist authors,  including SF authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Michael Moorcock, with an  introduction by Kim Stanley Robinson. It has a series of really useful  appendices, too: 'Anarchist fiction writers'—potted bios; 'Also of note'—other authors worthy of notice, though not necessarily identifying as anarchists  themselves; and 'Lists'—simple lists categorised as 'Stories that explore  anarchist societies', 'Stories that fictionalise anarchist history', 'Stories  that feature sympathetic anarchist characters', and 'Stories that feature  anarchists as villains'.
