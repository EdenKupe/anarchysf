  translation 1941); The Trial"
---

'In the Penal Colony' features a macabre execution machine which incises the nature of the crime into the victim's body. Michael Löwy, in his '[Franz Kafka and Libertarian Socialism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michael-lowy-franz-kafka-and-libertarian-socialism)', finds that "There are few texts in universal literature which present authority with such an unjust and murderous face."

*The Trial*—Kafka's best-known novel—isn't obviously science fiction, but Kafka's influence is sufficiently pervasive that John Clute has a long entry on him at [SFE](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/kafka_franz), concluding that "His work is a Baedeker to where we live now."
 
Current anarchist writers are clearly familiar with *The Trial: *[David Graeber](file:///C:\7%20Website\anarchysf\biblio.htm#Graeber 2015), for instance, sees it as paradigmatic of all great literature on bureaucracy, in taking the form of horror-comedy (p53); while for [Saul Newman](file:///C:\7%20Website\anarchysf\biblio.htm#Newman) "Kafka's *The Trial* might be understood in part as a meditation on voluntary servitude: rather than escaping the clasp of the law, which does not forcibly entrap him—on the contrary, it tries to repel and elude him—Joseph K persistently seeks his place within it, and in doing so constitutes the law's domination over him." (p145).

Kafka himself was evidently familiar with anarchism and anarchists, though the extent of his interest and degree of his activity are contested. A comprehensive account is given by [Löwy](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michael-lowy-franz-kafka-and-libertarian-socialism), concluding that "With his libertarian sensibility, Kafka has succeeded marvellously in capturing the oppressive and absurd nature of the bureaucratic nightmare, the opacity, the impenetrable and incomprehensible character of the rules of the state hierarchy as they are seen from below and the outside."
