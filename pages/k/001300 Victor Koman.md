_The Jehovah Contract_ is a bold (but ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to tackle religion head-on, the storyline concerning an assassin's mission to kill God. Though God and the Devil both end up dead, the magickal Goddess survives, apparently with the author's approval. 

_Solomon's Knife_ is an medical and legal tale regarding a new technique under which foetuses in line for abortion are instead transplanted into infertile mothers; the ethics of the procedure are thoughtfully discussed. In the acknowledgments Koman states that the germ of the idea was an offhand comment from agorist Samuel Edward Konkin III, and according to Wendy McElroy "Koman felt so bonded to SEK3 that he asked him to be the godfather to his only child" (_Samuel Edward Konkin III: Revolutionary Friend_: 47).
