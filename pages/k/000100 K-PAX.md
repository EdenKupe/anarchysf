A good film treatment of Gene Brewer's Swiftian novel (q.v.) of the same name. Not as well-received  generally as it might have been, perhaps because of a perceived naivety, which I  would prefer to see as intentional innocence, as counterweight to worldly  cynicism. The society of the (real or delusional) planet K-PAX is clearly both  anarchist and pacifist.
