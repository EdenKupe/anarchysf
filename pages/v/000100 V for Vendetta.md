Unsuccessful and politically sanitised  adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel (q.v.).
 
The film outraged anarchists for its wholesale  bowdlerisation of the anarchism of the original. Even before the  film was released, it was previewed by Iain McKay, on the anarchysf  mailing list, under the title "V for Very Annoying": a view he <a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/anarchist-science-fiction-few-random-thoughts-current-crisis"> confirmed</a> in 2013, saying "the politics are gutted". By the time  the film premiered in New York, an ad hoc group of anarchists there  had launched AforAnarchy.com, a website and education campaign  designed to reinject anarchist politics into the film, and to  radicalise its audiences. The website was well-received elsewhere in  the US, and in Spain, Turkey, the UK, Australia, and Singapore. <a href="http://www.anarkismo.net/article/3075?language=en&amp;topic=culture&amp;comment_limit=0&amp;condense_comments=false#comment2665"> Steve McFarland</a>, for afor@, defending against an accusation that  this was a naïve response to the inevitability of Hollywood, said  that they "simply saw the opportunity to hitch some anarchist  propaganda to a rampaging hollywood juggernaut, and provide a  gateway to the world of anarchism that is usually confined to the  margins". Tom Jennings, in his April 2006 _Freedom_ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140428043056/http:/www.tomjennings.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/VSigns.html"> review</a>, was unequivocally condemnatory, calling it a  "hopelessly incoherent mish-mash of random elements from comic book  superhero back catalogues [ . . . ] stitched together with the most  superficial philosophical musings about freedom and justice",  showing "utter contempt for its audience." The  anarchist scholar David Graeber, at that time a professor at Yale,  was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080313155014/http:/jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-05-02/launder-anarchistfight/"> unfazed</a> by the film, however: '“It didn’t upset me much,”  Graeber said. “I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of  Hollywood.”'

"This film has been widely criticised, but  critics overlook the film's valuable contributions. In the film, the  face of Fawkes provides the basis for sophisticated representations  of sexuality, mass media systems and anarchist political action.  Through its visual iconography, the film thus provides mainstream  cinema audiences with an effective introduction to the symbolic  vocabulary of post modern anarchism."

Despite the general hostility, the movie, its  director, and its screenplay all received special Prometheus Awards  in 2007. In 2013 the film was one of three recommended for viewing  as part of a Cornell University course on '<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130606175110/http:/history.arts.cornell.edu/HIST%201955%20SP13%20-%20Craib.pdf">Histories  of Anarchism</a>'.

Richard Porton devotes two pages to this film in the second edition of _Film and the Anarchist Imagination_, saying of it that "while neglecting the explicitly anarchist content of its source material [ . . . it] nevertheless grappled with the quandaries posed by both anti-authoritarian direct action and terrorism in the post-9/11 era."

Alex Prichard, in his 2022 reboot of _Anarchism, A Very Short Introduction_, notes that 

"The Wachowski Sisters {who wrote the screenplay} deployed anarchism in _V for Vendetta_ to speak to the creeping totalitarianism during the so-called 'War on Terror'. The Guy Fawkes mask made infamous by this film would become a key cultural marker of the anti-globalization movement, and the public face of the hacker movement Anonymous, for the next decade".
