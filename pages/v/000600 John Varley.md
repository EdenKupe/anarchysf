Jesse S. Cohn, in his 2024 _Hot Equations_, speculates that "'The Persistence of Vision' could be said to fetishize the condition of the deaf and blind [ . . . ] by using that condition as a prosthesis for the 'true' disability that is language itself [ . . . ]. The hitchhiker discovers, in their intimate, signless communion [ . . . ], a utopian alternative to the world of empty signifiers." (130)

_The Golden Globe_ was a Prometheus Award winner.
