title: "Ann and Jeff VanderMeer, eds - Sisters of the Revolution. A Feminist  Speculative
  Fiction Anthology"
---

A fine collection of stories, though only a  minority are science fiction per se.
 
It was reviewed at some length by <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/2016/09/06/brooding-over-revolution-and-bending-realities-sci-fi-as-social-movement-a-review-of-octavias-brood-science-fiction-stories-from-social-justice-movements-2015-ak-pressias-and-sisters-of-the-r/"> Kim Smith</a> in 2016, in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory  #29. Smith says the anthology "seeks to bolster a feminist archive  of science fiction", and "is a solid introduction to some creative  stories that engage the broad problematic of gender and patriarchy."  However, the anthology spans fifty years of stories, and for Smith:
 
This creates a bit of a challenge for the  collection: feminist movements of all stripes have radically changed  how gender and sexuality is conceptualized (and lived) over this  period – and whose experiences are reflected in those movements –  but these changes are not tracked in this collection. If speculative  fiction always has something to say about the present moment, but the work was written forty years ago, how do we read it  now? And how do we read a collection of works written at different  historical moments, in relation to different feminisms?
