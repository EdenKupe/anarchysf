_The Peace War_ and _Marooned in Realtime_ were  described, in a mailing to anarchysf, as an anarchist utopia. This is stretching  a point. Governments are condemned, but everyone seems to like throwing their  weight around.

_A Fire upon the Deep_ features the galactic society of societies, some of which are anarchies and all of which exist in one.  "For Vinge, an Anarcho-Capitalist with genuinely Anarchist views, anarchy is not so much a programme as a description of the existing state of affairs. We never emerge from the state of nature, and never can. There are in his world lots of statists, but no States, in the sense of authorities whose claim to legitimacy can be upheld or attacked."

'True Names' tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 2007.

'The Ungoverned' depicts anarcho-capitalists  defending against an invading government. It won the Libertarian Futurist  Society Hall of Fame Award in 2004.

'Conquest by Default' depicts an alien race in whose culture anything  goes, except that an elite caste of 'Umpires' intervenes to break up trusts and  prevent the formation of governments. <a href="https://brians.wsu.edu/?type=90&s=plas">Paul Brians</a> notes that it is "Very unusual in emphasizing the importance of cooperation and structure."

_Marooned in Realtime_ and _A Deepness in the Sky_ were Prometheus Award winners.
