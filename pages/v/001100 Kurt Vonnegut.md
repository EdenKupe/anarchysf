_Player Piano_ is a dystopia in which workers displaced by machines rise up against them, in the manner of the Luddites, but end up trying hard to repair them.  Pilgrim found the end  "depressing" — hardly surprisingly.  "Like much anti-utopian and anarchist writing the problem is stated and analysed efficiently but no solution is found." (Pilgrim 1963: 366) The novel is described by Yanai Sened as prescient, in the way it talks about automation, in the 2021 anarchySF

_The Sirens of Titan_ was said by <a href="https://libcom.org/files/Rad%20America%20V3%20I4.pdf">Arthur Maglin</a>  to depict "the construction of a society where no man takes advantage of any  other", and to have a big vogue "in hippy-type circles".

'Harrison Bergeron' is a satire on  authoritarian dystopias and perceptions of egalitarianism. Suggested at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction"> www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction</a>.

_Cat's Cradle_ centres on ice-nine, a supposed new crystalline structure of water which instantly solidifies any ordinary water with which it comes into context; whilst also featuring a deliberately and overtly bogus religion, Bokononism. <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Kurt-Vonnegut-Wrote-Some-Pretty-Good-Books-e16jpvq">			Kupermintz</a>, while noting that Bokononism sounds like bullshit, observes that it is based in powerful ideas such as comradeship, sticking together, and the self.

_Slaughterhouse-Five_ is discussed in part of the anarchySF <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Kurt-Vonnegut-Wrote-Some-Pretty-Good-Books-e16jpvq">
