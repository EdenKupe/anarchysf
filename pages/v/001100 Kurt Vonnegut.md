_Player Piano_ is a dystopia in which workers displaced by machines rise up against them, in the manner of the Luddites, but end up trying hard to repair them.  Pilgrim found the end  "depressing" — hardly surprisingly.  "Like much anti-utopian and anarchist writing the problem is stated and analysed efficiently but no solution is found." (Pilgrim 1963: 366) The novel is described by Yanai Sened as prescient, in the way it talks about automation, in the 2021 anarchySF 
<a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Kurt-Vonnegut-Wrote-Some-Pretty-Good-Books-e16jpvq">podcast</a> devoted to Vonnegut; in the same podcast Eden Kupermintz says the novel shows Vonnegut&#39;s breadth and versatility.

_The Sirens of Titan_ was said by <a href="https://libcom.org/files/Rad%20America%20V3%20I4.pdf">Arthur Maglin</a>  to depict "the construction of a society where no man takes advantage of any  other", and to have a big vogue "in hippy-type circles".

'Harrison Bergeron' is a satire on authoritarian dystopias and perceptions of egalitarianism. Suggested at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction"> www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction</a>. For <a href="https://greenanarchy.anarchyplanet.org/files/2012/05/greenanarchy17.pdf">A.Morefus</a>, in _Green Anarchy_ 17 (2004), the story "describes beautifully the appalling notion of enforced equality."

_Cat's Cradle_ centres on ice-nine, a supposed new crystalline structure of water which instantly solidifies any ordinary water with which it comes into context; whilst also featuring a deliberately and overtly bogus religion, Bokononism. <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Kurt-Vonnegut-Wrote-Some-Pretty-Good-Books-e16jpvq">			Kupermintz</a>, while noting that Bokononism sounds like bullshit, observes that it is based in powerful ideas such as comradeship, sticking together, and the self.

_Slaughterhouse-Five_ is discussed in part of the anarchySF <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Kurt-Vonnegut-Wrote-Some-Pretty-Good-Books-e16jpvq">
podcast</a> on Vonnegut: Kupermintz considers it "extremely good", a "Nobel-level" book. It's included in Libcom.org's reading guide to <a href="https://libcom.org/library/working-class-literature-reading-guide"> working class literature</a>.

The podcast also cites _Galápagos_, in which Sened comments that the author's foregrounding of meaninglessness becomes "a little bit annoying".

_Slapstick_ and _Jailbird_  are the only Vonnegut novels (tagged as sf) held by <a href="http://www.cira.ch/catalogue/index.php?lvl=categ_see&amp;id=346&amp;main=">CIRA</a>,  the Centre International de Recherches sur l'Anarchisme. _Jailbird_ is  also listed in Libcom.org's reading guide to <a href="https://libcom.org/library/working-class-literature-reading-guide"> working class literature</a>.

Vonnegut described himself as a pacifist,  an anarchist, and  a planetary citizen. (Vonnegut 1981, Granada pb edn: 124) <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/12/27/kurt-vonnegut-anarchist-and-social-critic/">Gaither Stewart</a> quotes him as saying "I’m fascinated by the Paris Commune for example, especially its branch of anarchism. People tend to hang onto natural anarchy. The life of Bakunin is useful. Seen as useful people, anarchists offer a fascinating alternative to big government today."
