<a href="https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/84428/BrandonHachey2024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">Brandon Hachey</a>'s 2024 masters dissertation looks at 'Climate Crisis Defeatism and Green Anarchism in Jack Vanceâ€™s _The Dying Earth_.'

Mark Bould, in _The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction_, notes that one point in _The Languages of Pao_ Vance suggests that an anarchist planet's language "might reflect rather than cause their politics."

For <a href="http://www.andersmonsen.com/50-works-of-fiction-libertarians-should-read/"> Anders Monsen</a>, _Emphyrio_ depicts "how casual acts of rebellion have  grave repercussions that can lead to more radical acts of rebellion." <a href="https://wconger.liberty.me/top-10-sci-fi-liberty-novels-you-probably-havent-read/"> Wally Conger</a> sums this old-school space opera as "one hell of a good freedom  novel".

Dan Clore lists _Wyst_ as "An 'egalist'  dystopia." The society  portrayed values leisure above all, and is energetically egalitarian. Though  interesting and entertaining, there isn't really much for anarchists here.
