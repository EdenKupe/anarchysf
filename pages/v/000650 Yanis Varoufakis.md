Very effective science fictional utopia, not anarchist per se (Varoufakis describes himself as a libertarian Marxist), but presenting a well thought out post-capitalist near future (2025), with explicit nods in the direction of anarcho-syndicalism. Not a prescriptive utopia, either, but more ambiguous, like Le Guin's. See Varoufakis's <a href="https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2020/09/05/another-now-my-political-science-fiction-novel-depicting-a-fully-fledged-socialism-we-could-have-had-the-guardian/">
website</a> for a fuller account.

One contributor to the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, in December 2020, found the book sufficiently interesting that he proposed setting up a discussion group, on this work and "possibly other democratic socialist, utopian visions".
