*Aurorarama *is polished steampunk set in a 'New Venice' in the Arctic c. 1908. Some characters are anarchists, but of the 'propaganda by the deed' school in favour at the time (or in steampunk time): a trope acknowledged by the author as "clichéd", in an interview published as postscript to the novel. Valtat further says:

"The political elements of this book exist because, of course, New Venice is a utopia, which, like every utopia, is actually a dystopia waiting to happen. At some point anarchy is regarded as an alternative, but it is anarchy in a very special sense: people from different walks of life getting together under pressure from the outside and trying to fix the situation so that they can regain some control of this utopia."

Reviewed by anarchist [FG](https://web.archive.org/web/20161129061226/www.leftbankbooks.com/sp.php), for whom it's hard to discern "whether he's selling anarchism to a crowd used to diluted fiction, or if he's selling dressed up fiction using anarchism. Either way, it was weird, imaginative, and constantly engaging." Margaret [Killjoy](http://www.whitecatpublications.com/interview-with-margaret-kiljoy/) found it "amazing".

*Luminous Chaos* is now the second part of what is to be a trilogy, *The Mysteries of New Venice*. It's a very entertaining steampunk tale of time travel to *fin de siècle* Paris, also with some anarchist minor characters.
