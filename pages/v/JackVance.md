For <a href="http://www.andersmonsen.com/50-works-of-fiction-libertarians-should-read/"> Anders Monsen</a>, Emphyrio depicts "how casual acts of rebellion have  grave repercussions that can lead to more radical acts of rebellion." <a href="https://wconger.liberty.me/top-10-sci-fi-liberty-novels-you-probably-havent-read/"> Wally Conger</a> sums this old-school space opera as "one hell of a good freedom  novel".
Â 
Dan Clore lists Wyst as "An 'egalist'  dystopia." The society  portrayed values leisure above all, and is energetically egalitarian. Though  interesting and entertaining, there isn't really much for anarchists here.
