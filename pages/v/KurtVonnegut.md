Player Piano is a dystopia in which workers displaced by machines rise up against them, in the manner of the Luddites, but end up trying hard to repair them.  Pilgrim found the end  "depressing"—hardly surprisingly.  "Like much anti-utopian and anarchist writing the problem is stated and analysed efficiently but no solution is found." (Pilgrim 1963: 366)
 
The Sirens of Titan was said by <a href="https://libcom.org/files/Rad%20America%20V3%20I4.pdf">Arthur Maglin</a>  to depict "the construction of a society where no man takes advantage of any  other", and to have a big vogue "in hippy-type circles".
 
'Harrison Bergeron' is a satire on  authoritarian dystopias and perceptions of egalitarianism. Suggested at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction"> www.metafilter.com/89983/Anarchism-and-science-fiction</a>.
