The earlier two novels were recommended by Zeke <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2017/09/11/review-the-doomed-city-by-arkady-and-boris-strugatsky/"> Teflon</a> in 2017 as entry points for readers new to the Strugatsky brothers.  Both are included in Bould's _Red Planets_  reading list.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/">Zakk Flash</a>,  on Facebook's Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, writes, of _Roadside  Picnic_, that "Although not  specifically anarchist, this looks interesting." On the same forum, Scott  Rossi confirms it as "really interesting". 

Teflon's 2017 article is principally a review of _The Doomed City_, an English translation of which had appeared for the first time the previous year. Teflon describes the novel—set in a place just described as the City, a location probably not on Earth, and the locus of an inexplicable Experiment—as "a bleak, brutal, and very thinly veiled critique of the Soviet Union and the ideology that produced it and all of its horrors." But apart from this political critique for Teflon it has little to recommend it, concluding that it was recommended "only for diehard Strugatsky fans and those with an interest in critiques of Leninism and the former Soviet Union."
