Co-author, with Robert Anton Wilson, of the _Illuminatus_ trilogy (see under Wilson and Shea); although Wilson's contribution was the most considerable, it was Shea who first suggested the subject. A member of the Social Revolutionary Anarchist Federation, for several years Shea edited an anarchist zine, _No Governor_. See, especially, his posthumous 2025 collection _Every Day is a GOOD Day_.
