_Islands in the Net_ was "Influenced by Bob Black's _The Abolition of Work_." (Dan Clore)  Black himself says "In _Islands in the Net_, Sterling extrapolates from  several anti-work stances: the "avant-garde job enrichment" [ . . . ] of the  laid back Rhizome multinational; the selective post-punk high-tech of  Singapore's Anti-Labour Party, and the post-agricultural _guerrilla_ nomadism of Tuareg insurgents in Africa. He incorporates a few of my phrases  verbatim." (Black 2015) _Islands_ has been perceived as an anarchist/anti-capitalist utopia (mailing to anarchysf).  Hakim Bey (Peter Lamborn Wilson), who describes himself as a Cyberpunk fan,  makes particular reference to this novel, as "based on the assumption that the  decay of political systems will lead to a decentralized proliferation of  experiments in living" . . . The book is among works discussed in the last chapter of Call's 2002 _Postmodern Anarchism_, which Call notes "raises the interesting possibility that networks might be used to challenge imperialism."

'Bicycle Repairman'  takes place in an anarchist squatters' enclave.

_Holy Fire_ was strongly recommended by  an anarchysf lister, describing it as "germane to this list because of its  treatment of the dynamics of a post-plague society, and social conservativism  among the very long-lived." A couple of minor characters are anarchists. Referenced by Sheehan (see bibliography), and by <a href="http://www.arivista.org/index.php?nr=242&pag=242_11.htm&key=science fiction"> Emanuela Scucatto</a>. Call devotes a couple of pages to _Holy Fire_, giving his view that its "radicalized anarchism is appropriate to a postmodern world in which power is as much linguistic and epistemological as it is economic or political."

In _Distraction_, early 21st  century America is "populated by large gangs of postmodern proletarian nomads."  "Sterling's vision is, in fact, profoundly anarchistic. [. . .] Distraction  updates pre-modern gift exchange for the postmodern age, and thus charts a  radically non-hierarchical vision of the near future." (Call, 2002) _Distraction_ is also among works discussed in the last chapter of Call's 2002 _Postmodern Anarchism_.

In 2015 Sterling wrote the introduction to  Bob Black's essay collection _Instead of Work_. While he says he "never  became a Bob Black disciple", "Mostly I just admired and tried to emulate his  conceptual freedom." (viâ€“vii)

_Pirate Utopia_ is a dieselpunk  alternate history centred on the curious story of the Free State of Fiume, in  the aftermath of World War I. Anarcho-syndicalists are among the players, but  it's an eclectic mix, also featuring fascists and futurists, Howard, Houdini,  and Lovecraft.
