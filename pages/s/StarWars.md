The Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, attempts to  destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star.
 
Although appreciative of the film, Jon <a href="biblio.htm#Osborne">Osborne</a> wrote that:
 
Many libertarians like this film because the good guys  here are explicitly trying to 'restore freedom to the galaxy.' [ . . . ]  However, the concept of 'freedom' is left conveniently undefined and the only  form of government mentioned on the side of good is a (presumably beneficent)  monarchy. This is really just a war between relative virtue and certain evil,  not a war of ideas.
 <a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/S/Star-Wars-1977-.html">Libertarian Movies</a>  also notes that "there's no overtly libertarian political message".
 
Stephen <a href="https://mises.org/library/films-liberty-and-state-1">Carson</a>  concludes "That two generations have grown up with these films teaching them to  hate the 'Empire' and it's plans to 'bring order to the galaxy' bodes well for  our future."
