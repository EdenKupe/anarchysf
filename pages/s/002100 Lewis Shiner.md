_Frontera_ was one of the first cyberpunk novels, and  was among those discussed by Donahoo and Etheridge in their 1992 <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jIOa_XhDNLMC&amp;pg=PT168&amp;lpg=PT168&amp;dq=&quot;Lewis+Shiner+and+the+'Good'+Anarchist&quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuW2VPiDhP&amp;sig=5ZFAdy0B4exQxb9dbLGAD9kzuBU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FtuZVIXIFam07gaFy4HYDg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&quot;Lewis Shin"> 'Lewis Shiner and the "Good" Anarchist'</a>.

Characters in _Deserted Cities of the Heart_ have  been seen as "perfect anarchists, demanding no pattern or meaning but accepting  what <em>is</em>—in fact, they are working to make their version of acceptance a  reality." According to Donahoo and Etheridge, "Shiner sees anarchy as a  cleansing force necessary for the destruction of decaying social structures that  are no longer viable, so that a newer, more functional society can evolve."

_Slam_ itself isn't actually sf. But it's hugely enjoyable,  so I'm happy to include it here. The novel is explicitly influenced by Bob Black's _The Abolition of Work_,  as acknowledged by Black. "Shiner  says: 'In fact, I was at a cyberpunk conference in Leeds this summer and one of  the participants gave a paper on my stuff. It was not a terribly theoretical  paper; his point was that all my books involve anarchy to one degree or another.  The anarchist is perceived as a positive force to reawaken a stagnant society.  He found this in a great number of my works. I'll buy into that, particularly  since the novel I'd already finished—Slam, which he hadn't seen—is a blatant  novel about anarchy. Genre distinctions or the presence or absence of certain  tropes in a work is a very minor detail compared to the other stuff.'"

Shiner is reluctant to self-identify as anarchist, but he  is a paid-up member of the IWW, and has stated that "I look to anarchists for  inspiration, for those gestures of defiance that I can use in my work"  (interview in Killjoy, 2009). In 2012 _Industrial Worker_ featured an <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/77024308/Industrial-Worker-Issue-1742-January-February-2012">interview</a> with him, in which he concludes with strong affirmation of the Wobblies.
