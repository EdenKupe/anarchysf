_Singularity Sky_ is included in Killjoy's list of stories that explore anarchist  societies, and is included in Zeke Teflon's list of his <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> favourite anarchist SF novels</a>.

_The Atrocity Archives_  and  _Glasshouse_ are included in the Anarchist  Studies Network's <a href="http://www.anarchist-studies-network.org.uk/ReadingLists_ScienceFictionandFantasy"> Science Fiction and Fantasy Reading List.</a>

_Accelerando_ was recommended by  Mumkin on <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/256904/No-More-Culture-Books-left-what-other-SF-is-like-Iain-Banks"> Ask MetaFilter</a>, and is noted in the comments on Worldbuilding's '<a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/17163/how-to-make-a-fictional-anarchist-society-believable-to-non-anarchists">How to make a fictional anarchist society believable to non-anarchists?</a>'.

_Iron Sunrise_ was recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel 'Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction' at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009. It is also included  in <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a>'s list.

_Glasshouse_  won the 2007 Prometheus Award. In <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a>'s list it is described as "A brutal tale about gender roles and  conformity."

According to <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a>, part of _Neptune's Brood_ "is set in a sympathetically portrayed deep sea anarchist  society of genetically modified humans." The author himself describes it as  "a parable for our times about the banking crisis and the spiralling growth of  debt that is rapidly enslaving us to a floating pool of transnational financial  instruments that nobody really understands or owns." [<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/09/crib-sheet-neptunes-brood.html">Charlie's  Diary</a>] The novel was inspired by Stross's reading of Graeber's _Debt: The First 5,000 Years_.

Teflon is clearly a Stross fan, as he waxed lyrical in his See Sharp Press <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/book-review-the-rhesus-chart-by-charles-stross/">review</a> of _The Rhesus Chart_. The 
novel is essentially a contemporary vampire story, with vampirism given a scientific explanation. "Both entertaining and substantive," for Teflon it is "highly recommended". The review is marred by a whinge about Britishisms.
