Dystopia set in England in 2084, a reductio ad absurdum extrapolation from Thatcher's infamous "There is no such thing as society". Corporations have complete control of a country in which the only sanctioned pronouns are 'I', 'me', and 'it' - even 'we' is obsolete. London is a lost cause, but the protagonist eventually has an epiphany and escapes to South Mimms where she is slowly deprogrammed. There is an improbable happy ending.

Self-published, which the text rather betrays, but it's entertaining, and expressed with vigour.
