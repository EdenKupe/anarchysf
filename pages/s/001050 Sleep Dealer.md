Interesting vision of resistance in a Mexico still exploited by the United States, but by means of remote robotic control without immigration from the south.

Categorised as a notable contribution to Latinxfuturism, it has been favourably referenced on anarchist Facebook pages. For <a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-iii-on-the-shores-of-communist-h-e-avens/">Javier Sethness</a> this film and <em>RoboCop</em> "critique borders, inequality, 
and labor in a manner consistent with anarchist principles, calling to mind the ongoing importance of class struggle, humanism, cross-border organizing, and migrant solidarity."
