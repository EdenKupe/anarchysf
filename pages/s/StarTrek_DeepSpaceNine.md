Second sequel series, set roughly concurrently with TNG  but on a space station rather than a starship. Viewed by SFE as "the best  of the Star Trek series and one of the finest science fiction series of  the last two decades."
Â 
There have been mixed responses to DS9.   Obsolete's review of Manu Saadia's Trekonomics favours this as  the best Star Trek series, saying: "I was pleased that Saadia spent  plenty of time on the Ferengi . . . after all, they are us. The capitalists, the  vice peddlers, the libertarian free-market worshippers." <a href="http://voluntarysociety.org/concept/index.html">Voluntarysociety.org</a>  also cites the Ferengi as an example of agorism or anarcho-capitalism. But  contributors to Reddit's DebateAnarchism thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/68nzht/anarchism_and_star_trek/"> Anarchism and Star Trek</a> have conflicting interpretations of the Ferengi, who  are to be seen as "evil capitalists", or as showing that, by this date,  capitalism has become impotent.
