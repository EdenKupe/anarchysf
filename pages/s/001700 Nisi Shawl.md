_Filter House_ was recommended by <a href="http://nwsfsnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-wanna-read-sf-anarchy.html"> Common Action</a> at the panel 'Beyond The Dispossessed: Anarchism and Science  Fiction' at the Seattle Anarchist Bookfair in October 2009, where Shawl herself  was a panellist. See her own '<a href="http://nisi-la.livejournal.com/17054.html">Armchair  anarchy list</a>'. _Filter House_ is included in a number of  interesting reading lists: <a href="https://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">Think Galactic</a>, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/112286-11-sci-fi-books-every-woman-should-read"> Paul</a>, <a href="http://invisibleuniversedoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IU_BSF_lit_2015_3000.jpg"> Dukan</a>, and Shawl's own <a href="http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/a-crash-course-in-the-history-of-black-science-fiction/"> Crash Course</a>.

_Talk Like a Man plus_ is another of the excellent PM Press Outspoken Authors series. The book was reviewed at some length by Rich Dana in the Spring 2020 _Fifth Estate_. For Dana, Shawl is "one of the genre's most adventurous talents", and this collection "is an excellent introduction to Nisi Shawl as a writer of speculative fiction as well as a person who thinks deeply about social issues."

_Everfair_ is also referenced in Dana's review. He says "An alternative history of the 'Belgian' Congo which the author describes as 'AfroRetroFuturist,'; _Everfair_ combines the aesthetics of Afrofuturism with the stylistic approach of the Steampunk science fiction sub-genre." Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations_ has three pages on this work. In my view it's a brilliant idea for a novel, but only imperfectly realised.Â
