Second outing in the franchise.
 
According to <a href="https://anarchistwithoutcontent.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/a-rebel-fraction-in-the-galactic-civil-war-or-doing-politics-in-molecular-times/#more-1487"> Anarchist Without Content</a>, this film was released just as "neoliberalism  begin collapsing the distinctions between mass society, subculture, and the  elite":
 
"If we look closely at _The Empire Strikes Back_,  released in the watershed year of 1980, we can see this very move in action:  first, the scoundrel and the princess suddenly cross class lines; next, trust  evaporates as Lando Calrissian betrays Solo in Cloud City; and in the stunning  finale, we find out that Darth Vader is Luke’s father. If this disorienting turn  of events did not upset the moral certainty of audience at the time, nothing  would."

A couple of contributors to the Facebook Anarchism and  Science Fiction Forum in 2016 listed this film as among their candidates for  'best sci-fi ever committed to film'.
