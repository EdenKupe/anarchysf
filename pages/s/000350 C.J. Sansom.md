Weighty alternate history novel set in a 1952 in which the UK had surrendered to Germany in 1940, after Dunkirk.

The novel was "Highly recommended" by Zeke Teflon in his 2015 Sharp and Pointed <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/review-dominion-by-c-j-samson/">review</a>. For Teflon, it is "almost flawless", and "tense and gripping from first page to last. It could well be the best alternate-history novel I've ever read."
