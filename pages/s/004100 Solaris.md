Not a remake of Tarkovsky's version, but a new version of  the Lem novel on which both are based.

One contributor to the anarchysf mailing list, after Lem's  death, "rather liked" the Soderbergh version. <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/layla-abdelrahim-avatar-an-anarcho-primitivist-picture-of-the-history-of-the-world"> Layla AbdelRahim</a> in 2009, however, "strongly disliked the trashy love-line  of the re-make".
