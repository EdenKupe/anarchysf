According to <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bolivia">SFE</a>, this novel "takes place in the future when Bolivia has ceased to exist as a nation, and in its stead a region called Qullasuyu Marka has been established. The indigenous people, after a revolt in 2022, have decided to rebuild the Aymara domain, wherein prevails a futuristic labour union ( . . . ). The strength of this novel is its anarcho-Feminist view, mixed language, vision of the overexploited world, and, above all, the involvement of the indigenous in the exploration of space."
