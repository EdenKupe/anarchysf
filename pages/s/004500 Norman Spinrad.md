_Agent of Chaos_ concerns an underground movement which ideologises  entropy as leading to chaos, and fights against the total control of the  Hegemony over the solar system. Said to have influenced young American  radical-anarchists in the 1970s (Platt:70), though it's hard to see why; there  is, however, a passage in chapter 11 in which the concept of freedom is linked  to that of the infinity of the universe, which equation is perhaps at the root  of the attractiveness of SF for many anarchists and libertarians.

For Michael Moorcock Spinrad used _Bug Jack Barron_  to "display the abuse of democracy and the media in America." (Moorcock 1978)

'Heirloom' is a minor anarchistic story, wholly derivative of Russell's '. . . And Then There Were None.'

For Moorcock _The Iron Dream_—a  heroic fantasy novel supposedly written by Adolf Hitler—was "intended to display the fascist elements inherent to the form." (Moorcock  1978) But for P.S., the same year, "Taken in small doses it is very funny. But  the parody of fascism repeated over and over again numbs the mind and becomes a  subliminal play for fascism." <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Zeke Teflon</a>, however, considers it one of his favourite anarchist science  fiction novels, describing it as "Alternately chilling and darkly funny. [ . . .  ] An excellent illustration of the ugliness of the authoritarian psyche."

"Spinrad says: '_Child of Fortune_ is  another anarchist novel, because there's no government.'" (Dan Clore) The message of the book is unequivocal: "True Children of Fortune  have no chairmen of the board or kings. True Children of Fortune seek not after  chairmen of the board or kings. Certainement, no true Child of Fortune would wish to be a chairman of the board or king!" (Bantam edn: 495)

_The Void  Captain's Tale_ is also set in a society with no government. (Lise Andreasen,  posting to anarchysf mailing list, 2010)

_Little Heroes_  and _Greenhouse Summer_ are included  in <a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy'</a>s list of stories that feature sympathetic  anarchist characters. Spinrad has said that his model, in _Greenhouse Summer_, "is some form of syndicalist anarchism—'anarchism that knows how to do  business'—no national governments per se." (<a href="http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Features/09_ShirleySocialFuture.html">Shirley</a>) _Greenhouse Summer_ is also included in <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a>'s list.

_He Walked Among Us_ is centred on a character who claims to be from the future who has travelled back in time to try to avert impending ecological disaster. The novel was the subject of a long and enthusiastic 2017 <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/revised-and-expanded-review-he-walked-among-us-by-norman-spinrad/">
review</a> by Zeke Teflon, for whom it is "arguably Spinrad’s best novel." He concluded that "I haven't read a book in ages I've enjoyed as much as He Walked Among Us. It's very, very funny, thought provoking, and in the end both touching and inspiring. In large part it's a love letter to science fiction and its potential to inspire change. I can't recommend this book highly enough." This is not a view I share. For me it's much too long, with the humour so drawn out that it just becomes tiresome, and one character whose first-person narrative is plain excruciating.

_Raising Hell plus_ is one of the excellent PM Press  Outspoken authors series. It was reviewed favourably by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/review-raising-hell-by-norman-spinrad/"> Zeke Teflon</a> on its release; and <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/book-review-raising-hell/">Luther Blissett</a>,  for _Freedom_, summed it up as "Fun story. Punchy essay. Well worth buying  and reading."

In a 1999 interview Spinrad confirmed that  he was "an anarchist—but I'm a syndicalist. You have to have organized  anarchy, because otherwise it doesn't work.' (Killjoy 2009)
