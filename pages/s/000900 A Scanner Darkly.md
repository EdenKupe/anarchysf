Fine film version of the Philip K. Dick novel, which was  in turn one of his finest. 

Categorised as subversive by Glenn, in the _BASTARD Chronicles_, who is not alone in  thinking that this is "the only film that faithfully adapted a story by him"  [Dick]. "It questions the War on Drugs, solipsism, personal relationships  between police and criminals. It asks if it is possible to spend your life  fighting something and become it."

William Gillis, at <a href="http://humaniterations.net/2009/12/31/top-10-sf-films-of-the-decade/">Human Iterations</a>, finds the film "an amazing triumph of everyday dystopia", with"a hauntingly utopian wish" at its core.
