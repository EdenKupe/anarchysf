title: "Kathryn Bigelow - Strange Days"
---

Set in the last two days of the 20th century, the film  follows the story of a dealer in illicit POV recordings of individuals' complete  sensory input as, while investigating the murder of a prostitute, he uncovers  the truth of the cop shooting of a black leader. Rather heavy-handed and  over-long, and the story-line—apart from the technological fillip—pretty  conventional, not to say old-fashioned.
 
 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140426223840/http:/www.tomjennings.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/RoseColoured.html"> Tom Jennings</a>, in 2006, took a much more positive view:
 
[ . . . ] Kathryn Bigelow's magnificent Strange Days  experiments viscerally with the phenomenology of simulation offered by new  media, gradually expanding the significance of their alienating distraction for  confused thrill-seekers out into the seething public sphere of a chaotic  neo-noir 1999 LA under brutal martial law. The troubled pairing of ex-vice squad  porn merchant Ralph Fiennes and streetwise action heroine Angela Bassett tangle  with corrupt entrepreneurs and lowlives in a decadent cross-fertilising cultural  milieu of hip-hop punk, blundering into a conspiracy to assassinate a Black  revolutionary leader which threatens to tip the civic millennium festivities  over the brink into grass-roots insurrection. Through an unprecedented synthesis  of film and psychoanalytic theory, exploitation of cinema traditions and bravura  design, editing and photography, it is far more nuanced than Crash in  tackling the subjective and social significance of race, as well as of gender  and class. The film also works hard to specify its historical contingency in the  best traditions of science fiction as speculation on the present (for example by  Stanislaw Lem, William Burroughs or Philip K. Dick)—rather than hysterical  inflation into universal values, or the fashionably subversive adolescent hype  which passes for philosophical resonance in [ . . . ] V for Vendetta (as  in The Matrix series). Strange Days even excuses its major flaws  (such as a deliberately implausible, if arguably utopian, central relationship)  by managing to render its politically ultra-conservative resolution as dystopian  recuperation—a final knowing flourish on the role of mass entertainment in  taming desire in labyrinths of repressive desublimation.
