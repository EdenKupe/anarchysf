Fine film version of the Philip K. Dick novel, which was  in turn one of his finest. 
Â 
Categorised as subversive by Glenn, in the  BASTARD Chronicles, who is not alone in  thinking that this is "the only film that faithfully adapted a story by him"  [Dick]. "It questions the War on Drugs, solipsism, personal relationships  between police and criminals. It asks if it is possible to spend your life  fighting something and become it."
