_Unkindness_ depicts rebellion against tyranny aboard a generation starship. Fairly familiar territory, but this is an exceptional debut novel with a very original take, and a fierce and feisty protagonist.

The author's own <a href="https://www.riverssolomon.com/bio">website</a> says, in no uncertain terms, "Rivers Solomon is a dyke, an anarchist, a she-beast, an exile, a shiv, a wreck, and a refugee of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. They write about life in the margins, where they are much at home."

The novel is a principal subject of one of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/An-Unkindness-of-Ghosts-and-the-Love-of-Saying-No-eof145">anarchysf podcasts</a>.

_Sorrowland_ recounts the experience of an escapee from a dystopian community, while she metamorphoses following infection by fungal spores. Jesse Cohn published an article on this work in _Extrapolation_ in late 2023, encapsulating the novel there as "a Black anarchist (or anarchic) exploration of radical freedom"; in his announcement of the article on the Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum Facebook page he further described it as "an extremely powerful book" which "points to some really fascinating intersections between canonical European anarchist thought, contemporary Black Studies, and various forms of New Materialism." In the body of his article Cohn says:

"Alongside the horrors of an antiblack world, an affirmative Black anarchist vision of mutual aid, collective autonomy, and leaderless communism runs through _Sorrowland_. Ultimately, Solomon doesn't just embrace or critique anarchism as understood within the tradition emerging in Europe in the nineteenth century; they deepen and extend it along lines suggested by Blackness, Indigeneity, and queerness by rethinking anarchism's attachment to white humanism, to modernity and its ontological Constitution."
