This short collection merited a full two-page review by Jim Feast in _Fifth Estate_, Fall 2022. Feast notes that "This writer has toiled for years within stultifying bureaucratic confines of the workaday world while maintaining sharp anarchist perspectives in her creative endeavours", and for the reviewer "_The Lady Anarchist Café_ mixes sardonic poems about the insanity and inanity of corporate office work with fetching sci fi stories of an escape to a (usually) more pleasurable future."

The stories themselves are only short, the longest fifteen pages, the shortest a single page. But they're tautly phrased and very effective. Feast drew particular attention to the title story, as well as 'The Dive' and the bleak 'The Edifice', and these are certainly the stand-outs; I would add the pleasing jest of 'Prosaic'.
