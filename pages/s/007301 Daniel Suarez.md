_Daemon_ and _Freedom TM_ together constitute an impressive techno-thriller some have seen as of anarcho-capitalist interest. There's a good long [web review](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/daniel-suarez-daemon-and-freedom/2010/04/26) by Kevin Carson of the P2P Foundation. Carson takes issue with what he sees as Suarez's naive assumption that corporate plutocracy can be defeated by restored constitutional government. And, though there are some interesting suggestions of an emergent society of "resilient local communities (holons) with micromanufacturing facilities, sustainable farming methods, and renewable energy sources", he concludes that "Iâ€™d prefer to see the triumph of resilient communities and darknets, and our delivery from global corporate tyranny, come about some other way than by a megalomaniac billionaire acting as *deus ex machina* from beyond the grave," which is in essence the premise of the whole narrative.

_Influx_ has a really strong premise, namely that a rogue US government agency is deliberately conspiring to suppress major technological advances, considering the pace of progress too fast for society to handle. But the second half of the book runs out of steam as it morphs into an all-action techno-thriller. Nevertheless, it won the 2015 Prometheus award.
