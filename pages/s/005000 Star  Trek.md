"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the  starship _Enterprise_. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new  worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man  has gone before."

Fred Bourgault-Christie, in <a href="https://zcomm.org/zblogs/star-trek-atheism-anarchism-and-the-power-of-vision/"> Star Trek, Atheism, Anarchism and The Power of Vision</a>, as an anarchist, but  not an atheist, nevertheless applauds Roddenberry's atheism, and in general  greatly admires the ethos of the show: "Star Trek shows us a future where people  calmly discuss issues, where they grapple with ethical and scientific challenges  with heart, where people cooperate. It shows us a world human beings would want  to live in." He says further: "I do have some problems with the future in which  Starfleet’s characters reside. I would prefer non-hierarchical organizations. [  . . . ] But the concepts of duty, respect (flowing both ways), and  responsibility in Star Trek are still inspirational, even to me as an  anarchist." "Anyone who wants to change the world or touch people should use  Roddenberry as an inspiration. Anarchists must create a vision that makes people  want to wake up in that world. [ . . . ] And if we on the Left want to make  people engaged and hopeful, we need to tell stories like Star Trek that show  people what the world can be like."

Reddit's DebateAnarchism has a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/68nzht/anarchism_and_star_trek/"> Anarchism and Star Trek</a>, seeking the views of anarchists on whether a  'benevolent' government as depicted in Star Trek could really exist.

In 2016 the <a href="http://www.anarresproject.org/star-trek-and-the-radical-imagination-oregon-state/"> Anarres Project</a> ran a programme of events in Oregon to mark the 50th  anniversary of the show. For the same occasion (but also tied to the US  presidential election) reason.com produced a 4-minute parody video <a href="http://reason.com/reasontv/2016/09/07/star-trek-the-libertarian-edition"> Star Trek: The Libertarian Edition</a>: "Their mission: to seek out new life and  new civilizations, and leave them alone. Trade with them if they want, but to  mostly leave them the hell alone." John J. Pierce, at <a href="a%20reasonably%20intelligent—if%20not%20profound—series">reason.com</a>,  considers the early _Star Trek_ "a reasonably intelligent—if not  profound—series".

A corrective to the general warm response to the series is  given in John Zerzan's <a href="http://green-anarchy.wikidot.com/star-trek">Star  Trek</a>, written for _Green Anarchy_ in 1994: "The vast popularity of this  impossibly weak, artificial, repressive series [ . . . ] is a puzzling and sad  symptom of an absence of both vitality and reflection." In particular, he finds  "repulsive" "its predication on a strict, martial hierarchy." Beyond that,  though, "What Star Trek conveys about technology is probably its most insidious  contribution to domination." Specifically, Zerzan is no fan of Gene Roddenberry  who, he reminds us, began his post-war working life working for the Los Angeles  Police Department.

David Graeber, in his 2012 essay 'Of Flying Cars and the  Declining Rate of Profit' (in Graeber 2015)  has a discussion on _Star Trek_ (and its successor, _The Next Generation_),  taking a different approach again:

"Or consider _Star Trek_, that quintessence of  American mythology. Is not the Federation of Planets—with its high-minded  idealism, strict military discipline, and apparent lack of both class  differences and any real evidence of multiparty democracy—really just an  Americanized vision of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union, and above all, one that  actually "worked"?

"What I find remarkable about _Star Trek_, in  particular, is that there is not only no real evidence of democracy, but that  almost no one seems to notice its absence.
[ . . . ]

"The Federation, then, is Leninism brought to its full and  absolute cosmic success—a society where secret police, reeducation camps, and  show trials are not necessary because a happy conjuncture of material abundance  and ideological conformity ensures the system can now run entirely by itself."
