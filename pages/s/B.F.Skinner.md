title: "B.F. Skinner - Walden Two"
---

Walden Two is a provocative utopia based on experimentation in  behavioural engineering. It's provocative because it's presented as a eutopia,  to be admired, whereas many people, and most anarchists, would regard  behavioural engineering as nightmarish totalitarian control. Frazier, Skinner's  mouthpiece, denies "that freedom exists at all" (Macmillan pb edn, New York,  1962: 257). In 1980 Skinner explained that
 Â 
 If acting for the good of the group is positively reinforced, people will feel  as free and worthy as possible. I am in favour of that. It is the best way to  promote government by the people for the people." (Skinner 1980: 5)
 Despite this apparent opinion of Skinner's that freedom itself is  just a weapon in the behaviourist's armoury, Walden Two presents  arguments that anarchists need to be able to answer, and should be read with  this in mind.
