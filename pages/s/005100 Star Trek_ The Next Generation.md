The first sequel TV series, set nearly a century after the  action of the original. Episode 18 of series 3, 'Allegiance', includes an alien  described as an anarchist who rejects any kind of authority; the stereotype is  the crudest, with the alien being essentially feral, wolf-like, and inclined to  unprovoked violence.

Fred Bourgault-Christie, in <a href="https://zcomm.org/zblogs/star-trek-atheism-anarchism-and-the-power-of-vision/"> Star Trek, Atheism, Anarchism and The Power of Vision</a>, focuses mainly on _TNG_: "If I am feeling sad or despairing at the world, I watch an episode of  Next Generation and feel a sense of hope."

A comment on Mike Gogulski's 2009 <a href="http://www.nostate.com/2917/are-you-really-a-libertariananarchist/">Are  you really a libertarian/anarchist?</a> says "Let's get to a technological state  where anarchy is theoretically possible as fast as we can, and see what happens.  I’m sure we’d *all* love to live in the Star Trek: The Next Generation  universe." But another replies "Not me. Sure, the technology, and the apparent  general environment of goodwill… but peek under that surface and it's either a  fascist/socialist dystopia, or TV fiction. They left hints throughout the series  of their wider socio-economic organization, and it's simply not possible without  some very nasty stuff happening just off camera."

For one contributor to Reddit's DebateAnarchism thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/68nzht/anarchism_and_star_trek/"> Anarchism and Star Trek</a>, "The federation around the TNG era is one of the  best examples of an anarchist/socialist society I have seen in fiction."

_TNG_ is also referred to in Zerzan's 1994 <a href="http://green-anarchy.wikidot.com/star-trek">Star  Trek</a>. He notes: "Sadly, Ursula LeGuin, considered by many a  utopian/anarchist writer, seemed to see little else besides Star Trek's PC  rating in her 'Appointment with the Enterprise: an Appreciation,' written for  the May 14, 1994 TV Guide. She gushed over the late series [i.e. <em>TNG</em>] in  the classic superficiality of the liberal, managing to see a marvellous morality  play, and ignoring its worship of authority and a monstrous techno-future."

For <a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-iii-on-the-shores-of-communist-h-e-avens/">Javier Sethness</a>, in 2021, and referring to this and the original series, 
"Whereas the Star Trek universe presents a cooperative, inter-species, post-capitalist future, wherein the peoples of Earth have abolished poverty, scarcity, and profit, it also resembles Le Guin's 'ambiguous utopias, as hierarchies of gender and&nbsp;race arguably persist in the Federation."
