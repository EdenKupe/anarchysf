Stylish and violent comedy/science fiction/horror/thriller, in which a psychotic  sociopath kidnaps a pharmaceutical company executive in his lone defence of  Earth against aliens from Andromeda in whom nobody believes but himself, yet in  the end the industrialist does indeed turn out to be the Andromedan king. If  it's not a cult movie, it ought to be.

"Capitalists are aliens!", as Bould's _Red Planets_ filmography notes laconically.
