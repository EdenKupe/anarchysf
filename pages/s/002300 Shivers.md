Described in <a href="http://obsolete-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/obso10finalwatermarksample.pdf"> _Obsolete_ #10</a>, in 2017, as a "masterpiece, in which a parasite runs rampant in a luxury high-rise apartment building, creating a population of sex-crazed zombies." The reviewer rightly compares it with Ben Wheatley's 2015 _High-Rise_, which reflects its "bizarre excellence."

Seen as "decidedly anarchist" in David Christopher's 2014 _Anarchist Studies_ article 'Early Cronenberg and the Anarchist-Apocalypse'.
