Steampunk animation with a rather simplistic storyline, but loving attention to the technology. The film is discussed by <a href="https://libcom.org/blog/2d-revolution-01092018">Reddebrek</a> at libcom.org, who comments that "neither government or capital come out of this film looking very good, they're both self interested and hypocritical."
