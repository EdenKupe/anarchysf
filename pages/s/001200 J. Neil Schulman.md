_Alongside Night_ "features an agorist-anarchist underground that eventually supplants the state." (posting to anarchysf).  Intentionally promoting the agorism of Samuel Edward Konkin III, it won the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1989.

_The Rainbow Cadenza_ won the 1984 Prometheus Award. Martin Moore Wooster, at

Libertarians in Space</a>, described it as "a subtle and underrated dystopia that deserves to be better known."

_The Fractal Man_ works hard at being funny, but is little more than an extended self-indulgent in-joke for agorists, in which multiple intersecting timelines incorporate sundry versions of Konkin himself, not to mention alternate versions of L. Neil Smith, Victor Koman, and Brad Linaweaver, and of course Schulman himself.
