Post-apocalyptic drama centring on a group of people who  have survived an accidentally released virus that kills most of humankind: in  the UK only about 7000 people survive.
 
The 2008 remake prompted a discussion at lib.com, on <a href="https://libcom.org/forums/theory/survivors-vs-anarchism-30112008"> "survivors" vs. anarchism?</a>. One contributor said he didn't think it likely  that an anarchist society could arise in a catastrophic situation like  near-extinction:
 
"libertarian communism will only come about with  participation of a widespread social movement that creates the conditions  through the actual praxis of that movement. With _Survivors_ we have  isolated scattered individuals coming together to form small groups where all  social norms have been rendered obsolete, so any group that wishes to form on  anarchist lines would need to arm themselves to defend against outside raiders  etc, a situation which wouldn't be compatible with libertarian communism."

For another, the remake was definitely inferior:
 
"The 70's series took time to develop about the problems of  setting up a community: growing things, getting things, settlement being  destroyed by food poisoning. It also didn't hold back on its punches, in one  episode (law and order) the main characters—who we had been shown as trying to  maintain their humanity—are shown as losing that humanity when they voted to  execute a character with learning disabilities who they falsely believe to have  raped and killed another character."

The same poster acknowledged, however, that the original  show had been too white and middle class, and objected that "the main  ideological thrust is that there needs to be a leader."
