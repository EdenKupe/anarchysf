title: "Cordwainer Smith - Instrumentality serie"
---

Smith's series, most recently assembled in two volumes (Norstrilia, and  The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Fiction of Cordwainer Smith), is an unfinished future history, mainly featuring 'underpeople'—humans  made from animal stock—in an unusual Chinese-influenced quasi-mythic narrative  style. The stories are variable in quality, but some are superlative sf;  nevertheless, they are basically right-wing in political orientation. Included  in the Red Planets reading list.
 
M. Eagle, in Freedom, found Smith's stories  "somewhat odd" . . . (Eagle 1969) This is perhaps not surprising given the  author's real identity as Paul M.A. Linebarger, godson to Sun Yat-sen, close  confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, and an expert on psychological warfare, known to  have done undocumented work for the CIA.
