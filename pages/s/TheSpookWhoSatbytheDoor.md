title: "Ivan Dixon - The Spook Who Sat by the Door"

In the then near future, the lead character is enlisted  into an elite CIA training programme, and is subsequently recruited as its token  black agent, but in reality consigned to a sub-basement where he is in charge of  the photocopier. He quits, returning to his home stamping ground, where he uses  his CIA training to develop an effective cadre of black guerrilla fighters.  Black uprisings ensue across eight major US cities. Very much a product of its  time, but despite its technical weakness now seen as culturally and historically  significant.

Its 2004 release on DVD was welcomed on the Anarchy-SF  mailing list. Included in the Red Planets  filmography.
