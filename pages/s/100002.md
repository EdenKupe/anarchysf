 An African-American model on a photo-shoot in Ghana visits the Cape Coast slave  castle, where traditional drumming transports her back, as it were in a trance,  to the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation slavery.
  
 Included in the Red Planets  filmography, but it's a bit of a stretch to see this as sf.
