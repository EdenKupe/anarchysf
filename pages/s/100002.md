An African-American model on a photo-shoot in Ghana visits the Cape Coast slave castle, where traditional drumming transports her back, as it were in a trance, to the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation slavery.
 
Included in the Red Planets filmography, but it's a bit of a stretch to see this as sf.
