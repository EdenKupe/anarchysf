One of the most important figures in the history of science fiction, Stapledon (like H.G. Wells) was a democratic socialist, who believed (also like Wells) that state socialism would and should develop into a stateless society. In _Last and First Men_ and _StarMaker_ this development is briefly portrayed. (Dan Clore) 

For <a href="https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/utopianstudiessocietyconf22/book-of-abstracts-2/">Dr Boyarkina Iren</a>, in _Last and First Men_ "post-individualism is dealt with in a series of dystopian/utopian societies of the future, some of them possess characteristics of communism, anarchism, etc."
