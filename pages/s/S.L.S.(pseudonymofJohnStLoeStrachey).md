title: "S.L.S. (pseudonym of John St Loe Strachey) - The Great Bread Riots: or, What
  Came of Fair Trade"
---

Following the abolition of free trade, the rioting of the unemployed is led by anarchical secret societies, based on violence, their organisation copied from those of Germany and Russia; the events are recounted as from 1934. It is a very slight work, of negligible interest for anarchists.
