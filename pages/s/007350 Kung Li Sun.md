Alternate history in which the revolution in Haiti is taken to the mainland US, and Charleston is seized by black and indigenous forces. Reads as YA, but not marketed as such.

The novel is discussed by Dylan Patrick Delos Santos Clymer at <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/organizing-disruption-by-dylan-clymer/">
anarchiststudies.org</a>, for whom it is "imbued with revolutionary conviction and hope", and "Without becoming didactic or clich√©, Sun shows us what an 
inclusive society which empowers Black, Indigenous, and queer people through solidarity, mutual aid, and direct action, can accomplish against the state." 
There is also a review by Carrie Laben in _The Anarchist Review of Books_ #4; Laben finds that the recognition "that the key to liberation is active 
solidarity driven by friendship and love, across racial, cultural, and national boundaries forms the emotional and thematic core of the novel. And this suggests 
that the better world possible in the pages of the book is still possible now."
