In _Blindness_ everyone suddenly and inexplicably  goes blind, and their world rapidly becomes a foul and smelly place where  everyone simply fends for themselves as best they can. In a _Guardian_ interview copied to the anarchysf mailing list in 2004 Ursula Le Guin, asked to  recommend modern authors who best represent the spirit of the Tao, singled out  Saramago for mention: "I think part of what appeals to me so much in the novels  of José Saramago is that his people go along with events without trying to  "master" them—they do by not doing. The woman who is  the central character of _Blindness_ is truly a great hero to me."

_Seeing_ is included in  Killjoy's list of stories that explore anarchist societies (in _Mythmakers & Lawbreakers_). It explores the consequences of an election in which the majority cast  blank votes. Not really sf, though.

Although according to <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/saramago_jose">SFE</a> Saramago self-identified as a "libertarian communist", he joined the Portuguese  Communist Party in 1969 and remained a member until his death.
