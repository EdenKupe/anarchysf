Intelligent and watchable successor series to _Star Trek: The Next Generation_.

_Anarchist Studies_ has an interesting 2022 article by María Angeles Castro and Javier Sethness Castro on
<a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/castro_picard/">Bibliophilia & Anarchism in Star Trek: Picard</a>, based on the first two seasons alone. The authors conclude that
"_Picard_ takes a critical view of Machiavellianism and bureaucratic domination wherever they may be found, both in fiction and (by extension) in reality. As such, the series communicates an anarchist, transhumanist spirit that rejects the neo-fascism of the Romulan Empire and Confederation, plus the dystopian socialism of the traditional Borg and 'über-Synths' alike."
