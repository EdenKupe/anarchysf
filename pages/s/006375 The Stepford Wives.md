Well-known feminist allegory depicting a small town in Connecticut where the men have conspired to replace their wives with accommodating humanoid replicants. Though perhaps not very subtle, the film is still disturbing half a century after its production.

The film was directly referenced by Jess Flarity in _Fifth Estate_ #413, Spring 2023, in the context of a review of Johanna Isaacson's 2022 book of contemporary horror criticism, _Stepford Daughters_.
