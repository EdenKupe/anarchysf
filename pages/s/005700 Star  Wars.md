The Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, attempts to  destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star.

Although appreciative of the film, Jon Osborne (see bibliography) wrote that:

"Many libertarians like this film because the good guys  here are explicitly trying to 'restore freedom to the galaxy.' [ . . . ]  However, the concept of 'freedom' is left conveniently undefined and the only  form of government mentioned on the side of good is a (presumably beneficent)  monarchy. This is really just a war between relative virtue and certain evil,  not a war of ideas."

<a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/S/Star-Wars-1977-.html">Libertarian Movies</a>  also notes that "there's no overtly libertarian political message".

Stephen <a href="https://mises.org/library/films-liberty-and-state-1">Carson</a>  concludes "That two generations have grown up with these films teaching them to  hate the 'Empire' and it's plans to 'bring order to the galaxy' bodes well for  our future."

David Graeber, in his 2007 'On the Phenomenology of Giant Puppets' (included in his 2024 _The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World . . ._) noted that the imperial stormtroopers "stand in American popular culture as one of the most familiar archetypes of evil. This point is not lost on the anarchists, who have since A16 taken to regularly bringing recordings of the imperial stormtrooper music from Star Wars to blast from their ranks as soon as a line of riot cops start advancing."
