Unusual blend of sf and dreamscape, in which a city has fragmented into curiously themed neighbourhoods: one for geeks, one for office-based workaholics, one run by cats, one for individuals who believe their souls are shaped like Frisbees, and so on. Strange, but very readable.

Recommended by a poster to the old anarchysf mailing list, in 2000.
