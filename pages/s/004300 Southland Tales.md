Really, don't waste your time with this movie, for which  I'm not going to provide even a single sentence plot summary. It's incoherent  drivel.

Mark Bould included it in his _Red Planets_ filmography, as a  "depiction of the era of Homeland Security", which I suppose is accurate in  part, so far as it goes.

Notwithstanding the <a href="http://diptastical.blogspot.co.uk/">Diptastical</a> review, there are  no anarchist characters.
