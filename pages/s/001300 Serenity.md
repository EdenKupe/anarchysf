Space Western; a repackaging of what had been  intended as the second series of TV's _Firefly_.

Winner of a Special Prometheus Award in 2006.

Rocha and Rocha's _Joss Whedon, Anarchist_ has a few pages on the film considering the extent to which its principal characters are libertarian or "anarcho-socialist."

For William Gillis, at <a href="http://humaniterations.net/2009/12/31/top-10-sf-films-of-the-decade/">Human Iterations</a>, "it is precisely Serenityâ€™s linear, unraveling, scattershot density that marks it as a unique product of SF and a solitary masterpiece in the realm of film. [ . . . ]  Compressed seasons of Firefly or not, the film drips with the love it is clearly a labor of."
