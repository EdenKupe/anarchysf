For Arthur Uloth, "This strange book has not the  compulsive power of _1984_. Yet it wears better than many other prophecies,  and could still come true." A post-holocaust novel, for Uloth ". . . the  sub-medieval society Jefferies describes could still come into being, indeed it  is the most likely sort of society to do so after an atomic war, unless all life  were obliterated." (Uloth 1963: 380)
