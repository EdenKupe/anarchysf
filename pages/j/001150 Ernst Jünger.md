Jünger himself seems a rather remarkable author, with a career spanning the whole period of German history from the era of the Kaiser right through to post-reunification in the 1990s; the author died aged 102. <a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2020/03/the-man-of-the-twentieth-century-4/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=b65fceba9cb91184083d8e66fa759bff89c2edfd-1589818298-0-AXm50SRXNCBN4cvRyktO0xDvB1h16SzX2LP5ymT3Ggyb3gTlNPiiUXR_Fo645OdhwYem_S4HwatEG-T1VFuXR0KV26yqSnehjyDVkEm9K">Morgan</a> gives a useful account of his life. 

<em>Eumeswil</em> dates from his later life. It's undeniably sf, but is pretty demanding on the reader, and far indeed from the pulpier end of the market. The novel is written in the first person by a historian, living in a city state in a future after a "world civil war"; the state, Eumeswil, is essentially a dystopian dictatorship, where the narrator is himself part of the dictator's inner circle. The narrative is of explicit anarchist interest, and it's clear that the author was very familiar with many aspects of the anarchist history of the last two centuries. In particular the influence of Max Stirner's individualist anarchism is marked. But the narrator, and presumably the author, is keen to draw a distinction between what he sees as the 'anarchist', and his self-characterisation as an 'anarch'; this he sees as going with the territory: "Every born historian is more or less an anarch. . . ." But to me Jünger's anarch seems closer to Nietzsche than to Stirner: more <em>Übermensch</em> than <em>Einzige</em>.

Dylan Patrick Delos Santos Clymer, writing for <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/organizing-disruption-by-dylan-clymer/">AnarchistStudies.org</a> in 2022, described Jünger's anarch as "A type of egoist of the Stirner tradition, which lies in complacent wait for his tyrant to either grant his freedom or for revolution to distract his oppressors enough for to escape and disappear from the conflict altogether."

The work is also reviewed by <a href="https://winteroak.org.uk/2024/11/29/primeval-freedom-the-anarch-and-the-anarchist/">Paul Cudenec</a> in 2024, expanding on the anarchist/anarch distinction, and
