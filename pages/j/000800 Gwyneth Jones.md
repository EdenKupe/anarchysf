_White Queen_ is the first book in a trilogy, an  intelligent and complex account of first contact. Mark Bould's _Red Planets_ bibliography describes it as an  "Ironic green-socialist-feminist-postcolonial revision of the alien invasion  narrative." Included in the <a href="https://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">Think Galactic</a>  reading list, and on <a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/radical-wormholes-our-favourite-science-fiction/"> Red Pepper</a>'s list of "sci-fi novels that punch holes in capitalist reality."
 
'2020' is a rather gross (unless you're a coprophile) near-future  story, so far only ever published in Farah Mendlesohn, ed.: _Glorifying  Terrorism_, an anthology written in deliberate defiance of the UK  government's Terrorism Act 2006 banning all "glorification of terrorism". The  title is a reference to the Sex Pistols.
 
Included in  Killjoy's list  (see bibliography) of stories that feature sympathetic  anarchist characters.
 
(My thanks to Gwyneth for a reading copy of  the story.)
