Blurb: There is only THE MACHINE and those who live within it. Told through the  unconventional, simple language of blue 7, one of the millions of workers who  scurry through its metallic entrails, THE MACHINE tells of a brutal regime and  the beginnings of rebellion within . . . Working without purpose and without end, humanity lives and slaves to maintain  the huge mechanical leviathan, beyond which there is nothing. Blue 7 has spent  his lifetime working and wondering the function of THE MACHINE, but someone has  noticed him, and slowly his world begins to unravel in a bloodsoaked violent  struggle that threatens not only him, but THE MACHINE itself. A sharp anarchist critique of the modern world devoid of imagination and  freedom, THE MACHINE pierces through the thin surface of western capitalism, and  asks difficult questions of modernity.

This blurb describes _The Machine_ pretty well, but doesn't capture its  relentlessly dark and Kafkaesque desperation.
