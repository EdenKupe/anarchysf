Describes the first few months after the apocalypse, in which mutual aid comes to the fore among survivors, who realise in due course that the true dystopia was what went Before. While pulling no punches, the book is joyfully warm and funny, the earthiness especially brought out by the Scots-inflected dialect employed throughout.

Johnston is himself an anarchist, with a strong background as an activist. There's a good interview with him about his work, and about this novel, on the Anarchist Federation website (see <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/wcl-5-6-dd-johnstons-proletarian-apocalypse/#/">DD Johnston’s proletarian apocalypse</a>). Johnston's own website also has a page on <a href="https://ddjohnston.uk/essays/politics/">Politics</a>—a really interesting essay on the role of anarchism in fiction—given that "writing is necessarily a political act."

The 2023 <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/2023/08/18/and-then-the-lights-go-oot-forever-disnaeland/">_Freedom_</a> review, describing the novel as "perhaps the most hopeful apocalyptic novel you’re ever likely to read," concludes that "It’s not necessary to be an anarchist to enjoy Disnaeland, but it’s certainly a novel that has a lot to offer anarchist readers."
