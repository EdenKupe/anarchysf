Arthur W. Uloth, who had been editor of the Anglo-American anarchist publication Man! in the mid-1950s, in succession to individualist anarchist S.E.  Parker, contributed a number of reviews of works of science fiction to  Freedom in the period 1954 to 1963. He also contributed a five-page article,  on the Richard Jefferies novel After London, to the same 1963 issue of  Anarchy in which John Pilgrim's noted article appeared.
