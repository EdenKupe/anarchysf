This utopian narrative  revisits some of the most controversial topics of the philosophical debate on  Anarchism, while simultaneously offering practical alternatives to previous  models of libertarian communism." Quiroule  founded _La Liberté_ (1893–1893) and was a member of the editorial board of _La Protesta_, which was the most  representative publication of anarchist journalism in Argentina; he was "one of  the most prolific authors of the Argentine Libertarian movement". The  fully-fledged utopia of the 'Ciudad de los Hijos del Sol' (complete with  fold-out map of the anarchist city) is  set in a future apparently around 1930.

The work is the second  volume of a trilogy, the other parts being _Sobre la ruta de la anarquía  (On the Route to Anarchism)_ (1912) and _En la  soñada tierra del ideal (In the Dreamt Land of the Ideal)_ (1924).  The first volume describes a  successful urban revolution in Europe, inspired by the 1871 Paris Commune. The  final volume depicts a nameless city in the distant future, and explores  confrontation between syndicalists and anarchists. The text of the complete  trilogy may be found at the Internationaal Instituut voor Sociale Geschedenis (IISG),  Amsterdam.
