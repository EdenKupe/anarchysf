Adam Roberts, in his 2016 2nd edition _The History of  Science Fiction_, notes the '"well-realised anarchist Martians" of 'A Martian  Odyssey', which was the first important SF story to treat aliens  sympathetically. 'Valley of Dreams' is the sequel: in fact a revision of the first draft of that story, featuring the 'dream-beasts'. It explicitly identifies the Martian polity, or at least that of Tweel's people, as anarchy, and furthermore has one of the Earth explorers defending it as such, describing anarchy as "'the ideal form of government, if it works,'" and government as "'a primitive device'" and "'a confession of weakness'" (1977 Sphere pb edn of _A Martian Odyssey and Other Stories_, p. 56). Jarvis, anarchy's advocate in the story, does not however expect humans to be advanced enough for its realization on Earth for "'a good many centuries'" (57). 

'The Ideal' centres on a machine for actualising people's ideals. The story includes a passage in which the machine's inventor proves that "anarchy is the best government"; this proposition, coupled with the inventor's apparent belief that anarchy is compatible with nations and warfare, rather casts doubt on Weinbaum's real understanding of the issue.
