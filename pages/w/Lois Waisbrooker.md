A minor utopia, in which women are given men’s power for fifty years, as an experiment, and society quickly shifts for the better.

Waisbrooker was an established anarchist with a side-interest in spiritualism, who later lived in an anarchist commune at Home, Washington, USA. She published a couple of newspapers, including one called called <em>Clothed With The Sun</em>, and for this she was one of two anarchists from Home to be found guilty of a crime in the repression that followed the 1901 assassination of President McKinley at the hands of the self-proclaimed anarchist Leon Czolgosz.
