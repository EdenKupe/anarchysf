Utopian novel in which a Venusian emissary convinces an American family of the superiority of his society's ways, as a first step towards the uplifting of Earth's population. The story is vitiated by wagon-loads of pseudo-science centring on magnetism and phrenology, of which the author was an exponent. But if you can get past the nonsense there are quite a few radical ideas there too, not least those centring on "sex and gender issues concerning women's emancipation, marriage, free love, sexuality, and voluntary motherhood", as well as some healthy disrespect for contemporary Christianity. The work is discussed by Brigitte Koenig in her chapter of Davis and Kinna, eds, _Anarchism and Utopianism_, where it is explicitly treated as an anarchist utopia. Koenig notes that the novel was advertised directly in the American anarchist and sex-reform journal _Lucifer, the Light Bearer_, in 1898.
