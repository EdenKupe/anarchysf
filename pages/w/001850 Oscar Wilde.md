Gray's portrait ages horribly, while its living subject enjoys an immoral life without aging. Not really sf, but close enough to be bear comparison with Stevenson's slightly earlier _Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_. Agathe Brun, in her chapter 'Wilde and the Victorian Mould: The Artist's Individualism through Anarchy' (in Jeff Shantz, ed.: _Literature and the Anarchist Imagination_), says of this, Wilde's only novel, that "Wilde highlights the eternal weakness of men: going by appearances. Dorian's beauty and youth give him whatever he wants but his soul is lost and the stupidity of people around him is revealed." More relevantly to anarchism, the chapter considers in greater depth Wilde's non-fiction _The Soul of Man under Socialism_.
