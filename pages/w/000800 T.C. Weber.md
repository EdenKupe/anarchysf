Described by the author (private  communication) as a "cyberthriller featuring anarchist characters and  themes":

"In _Sleep State Interrupt_, a giant media corporation has taken over the  Internet, created an addictive virtual reality called BetterWorld, and controls  nearly all information. Politicians do their bidding and a brainwashed humanity  serves a privileged few. Waylee Freid, an unemployed Baltimore journalist with  ever-worsening bipolar disorder, is the only hope for a brighter future. She and  her activist friends bust a notorious teenage hacker out of jail and sneak into  a closed presidential fundraiser at the Smithsonian castle, where they hope to  record incriminating admissions that will wake up the world. Hunted by Homeland  Security, Waylee and her friends must reach a sufficient audience by  broadcasting their video during the Super Bowl. But to do so, they'll have to  break into one of the most secure facilities ever built."

_The Wrath of Leviathan_ is the second volume of what is now the BetterWorld trilogy.
