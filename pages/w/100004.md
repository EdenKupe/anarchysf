Loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel, with 			quite a few liberties taken.
 
Mark Bould, in his 2005 Socialist Review 			article, copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list, notes that "The 			shrill religiosity of the 1953 film version of War of the Worlds 			signalled the turn to consolation in the face of a nuclear cold war 			evident in the 1950s US Protestant revival."
