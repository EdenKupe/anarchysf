title: "Rex Warner - The Wild Goose Chase (1937); The Aerodrome"
---

The Aerodrome is a rather earnest farce concerning  a sluggish rural village and a hyperefficient neighbouring aerodrome, examining  the fascination of authoritarianism. George Woodcock found this political allegory  "ultimately more satisfying than any of Kafka's." (Woodcock 1948)
Â 
The Wild Goose Chase is also  discussed, noncommittally, in Woodcock 1948.
