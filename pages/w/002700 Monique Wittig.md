_Les Guerillères_ is a poetic evocation of a band of  women fighters for liberation from sexist oppression. It is quoted prominently,  but without comment, in _Open Road_'s 1978 article. In its emphasis on the  necessary purgative power of destruction as a prerequisite for creation it is  close to Bakunin's formula equating the two. The novel is also seen as part of the "canon of transgressive revolutionary literature", by <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/408-winter-2021/bullet-points/">Stacy Flynn</a>, writing in _Fifth Estate_ #408 in 2021.
