The Aerodrome is a rather earnest farce concerning  a sluggish rural village and a hyperefficient neighbouring aerodrome, examining  the fascination of authoritarianism. George Woodcock found this political allegory  "ultimately more satisfying than any of Kafka's." (Woodcock 1948)
 
The Wild Goose Chase is also  discussed, noncommittally, in Woodcock 1948.
