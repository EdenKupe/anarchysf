The neurologist and pioneer of robotics Grey Walter, father to well-known British anarchist Nicolas Walter, was himself, according to his obituary in _Freedom_, "an anarchist fellow-traveller during the 1950s and 1960s". _Further Outlook_, his only novel, is there described as "expressing his utopian vision of a libertarian society" (A.F. 1977). It tells of the early stages in a space programme led by a handful of Britons; the narrative is interrupted for a 70 page account, supposedly written in 2056, of developments in the world, particularly social developments, up to that year. The society is a loosely structured arrangement described as "Statistical Syndicalism", apparently a kind of 21st century guild socialism. The weakness of the book's plot doesn't sustain this utopian digression, which is really of not very great interest.

Walter is quoted by Elliot Murphy in the 2019 _Palgrave Handbook of Anarchism_, on the advantages of collective models of political and naturalistic phenomena.
