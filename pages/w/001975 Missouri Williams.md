Following an unspecified catastrophe, a small incestuous community, viewed from within, is essentially devolving. The novel was reviewed by Nick Mamatas, in _The Anarchist Review of Books_ #4, who concludes:

"Is the book any good? It's brilliant, in the way a nuclear explosion is brilliant. And as the real end of history will one day be, it resolutely refuses to be a good time."
