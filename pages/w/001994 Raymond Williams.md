Set in its then near future (1988) the novel is a thoughtful political thriller set in a repressive Britain (extrapolated from what came to be called Thatcherism). The volunteers are essentially entrists, but the author's sympathies are with the more effective direct action by workers at a coal depot. Stephen Knight, in his 'Anarcho-syndicalism in Welsh fiction in English,' a chapter in Klaus and Knight's 2005 _'To Hell with Culture'. Anarchism and Twentieth-Century British Literature_, has a page on this novel, in which he notes that "Williams was attracted to the rigorously and vigorously democratic politics that are best described, and well known in Wales, as anarcho-syndicalism" (63).
