In a near-future theme park based on the American Old  West, androids malfunction and begin to kill visitors.

The film is discussed at some length by <a href="https://aaeblog.com/2016/12/24/the-road-to-westworld/">Roderick Long</a>, who found  it "a good movie", but with "no aspirations to the narrative complexity and  thematic ambition of the HBO series" of 2016.
