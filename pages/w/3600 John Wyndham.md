The Day of The Triffids is a well-known disaster  story centring on murderous plants. In The Kraken Wakes 4/5 of the world  population dies from the onslaught of aliens who invade the ocean deeps. Both  novels were named by D.R. in Freedom's 1958 review of Maine's The Tide  Went Out, as earlier examples of the same genre.
