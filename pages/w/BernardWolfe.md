Black comedy set in a future in which disarmament is interpreted literally and amputeeism is exalted as the highest form of uncompromising pacifism. For John Pilgrim it is  "a complex novel of the manner in which the world's most idealist government inevitably follows the laws of the nature of power." (Pilgrim 1963: 375).
