Wilson, who died in 2022, was a lifelong anarchist, and in the words of his _Fifth Estate_ obituarist, <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/david-tighe-remembering-peter-lamborn-wilson/">David Tighe</a>, "one of our truly great anarchist literary figures."

'Alchemy' is a 4-page poem/manifesto with SF elements, published in _Fifth Estate_ #373, Fall 2006.

_False Documents_ is a very diverse collection of pseudo-real fictions rather in the Borgesian vein. The best of these, and certainly the most relevant here, is '<a href="http://www.sonsorol.org/port_watson.html">Visit Port Watson!</a>', which is a spoof travel-guide to the utopian island of Sonsorol, playfully combining ideas from various libertarian strands. It was first published in 1985, in Rucker, Wilson &amp; Wilson, eds: _Semiotext(e) SF._

_Night Market Noodles_ collects five more stories, described by <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/david-tighe-remembering-peter-lamborn-wilson/">Tighe</a> as "sci-fi-inflected". All are of interest, though perhaps 'My Summer Vacation in 1911' is the most on point, as a time travel story engaging with figures of the Belle Époque, including Apollinaire, Jarry, Picasso, Satie, Félix Fénéon, and Jules Bonnot.
