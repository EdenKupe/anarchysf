Unusual anarchist plot story, in which the anarchists systematically steal electricity by means of giant capacitors, but also involving the invention of a powerful megaphone capable of addressing the whole of London, not to mention an extraordinary repurposing of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral as a giant telephone transmitter.

Franklin Rosemont has a paragraph on this "real literary curiosity" in his 2012 'A Bomb-Toting, Long-Haired, Wild-Eyed Fiend: the Image of the Anarchist in Popular Culture' (_Surrealism, Bugs Bunny, and the Blues_ (2025), p76).
