Woodcock—best-known for his 1962 book Anarchism: A  History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, but later a prolific author and  significant man of letters in his adopted country of Canada, was an anarchist  throughout his life. Among his works were book-length biographical studies of  Aldous Huxley (Dawn and the Darkest Hour, 1972) and George Orwell (The  Crystal Spirit, 1966), not to mention his biography of William  Godwin, Mary Shelley's father (William Godwin: A Biographical Study,  1989). Woodcock became a personal friend of Orwell's, and kept up a  correspondence until the latter's death. They were both active members of the  Freedom Defence Committee at the time of the 1945 prosecution of four editors of War Commentary for incitement to disaffection; Woodcock was secretary,  Orwell vice-chairman.
