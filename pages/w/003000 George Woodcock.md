Woodcock—best-known for his 1962 book _Anarchism: A  History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements_, but later a prolific author and  significant man of letters in his adopted country of Canada, was an anarchist  throughout his life. Among his works were book-length biographical studies of  Aldous Huxley (_Dawn and the Darkest Hour_, 1972) and George Orwell (_The  Crystal Spirit_, 1966), not to mention his biography of William  Godwin, Mary Shelley's father (_William Godwin: A Biographical Study_,  1989). Woodcock became a personal friend of Orwell's, and kept up a  correspondence until the latter's death. They were both active members of the  Freedom Defence Committee at the time of the 1945 prosecution of four editors of _War Commentary_ for incitement to disaffection; Woodcock was secretary,  Orwell vice-chairman.
