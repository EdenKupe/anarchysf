Loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel, with  quite a few liberties taken.

Mark Bould, in his 2005 _Socialist Review_  article, copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list, notes that "The  shrill religiosity of the 1953 film version of _War of the Worlds_ signalled the turn to consolation in the face of a nuclear cold war  evident in the 1950s US Protestant revival."
