Les Guerillères is a poetic evocation of a band of  women fighters for liberation from sexist oppression. It is quoted prominently,  but without comment, in Open Road's 1978 article. In its emphasis on the  necessary purgative power of destruction as a prerequisite for creation it is  close to Bakunin's formula equating the two.
