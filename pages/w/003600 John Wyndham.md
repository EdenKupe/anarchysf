_The Day of The Triffids_ is a well-known disaster story centring on murderous plants. In _The Kraken Wakes_ 4/5 of the world population dies from the onslaught of aliens who invade the ocean deeps. Both novels were named by D.R. in _Freedom_'s 1958 review of Maine's _The Tide Went Out_, as earlier examples of the same genre.

_The Chrysalids_ centres on the escape from persecution of a group of mutant telepaths. Zeke Teflon, in his list of <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/a-few-favorite-atheist-science-fiction-novels-and-books-on-cults/">Notable Atheist Science Fiction Novels</a>, describes it as "A nicely written 
early post-apocalyptic tale of religious ignorance, arrogance, and brutality, and escape from it."

_The Midwich Cuckoos_ is described on the Freedom Press <a href="https://freedompress.org.uk/product/the-midwich-cuckoos-john-wyndham/"> website</a> as "the classic tale of aliens in our midst, exploring how we respond when confronted by those who are innately superior to us in every conceivable way."
