Made for TV depiction of what it might be like after a nuclear attack on England, deemed by the BBC too shocking to broadcast, so never aired on UK TV until 1985. That, at least, was the official line, but Bleart 
Thaqi, in an anniversary article for <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/08/08/the-war-game-still-too-real-to-broadcast/">Freedom</a>, suggests that "The film lays bare governments’ and militaries’ obscene confidence in their ability to manage annihilation. The BBC’s refusal to 
broadcast the film, combined with secret viewings for the Home Office and military officials, revealed that the gatekeepers of information feared that the public might wake up." "Sixty years on, _The War Game_ remains not only relevant, but necessary. Not because it foretells exactly what will happen, but 
because it shows what always can, and what, in some form, already has. We ignore it at our peril."
