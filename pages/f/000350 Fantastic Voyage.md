A submarine and its crew are microminiaturised and injected into a patient's blood stream to destroy a blood clot on the brain with a laser. Pretty silly stuff, but rather surprisingly it received a <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/15-october-1-15-1966/a-fantastic-voyage/">review</a> in _Fifth Estate_ #15, by Noel Cooper, who did little more than pr√©cis the "extremely off-beat" story.
