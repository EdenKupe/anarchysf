Escape story set in a future semi-automated  private-enterprise underground prison and an authoritarian United States  operating a draconian one child policy.

Jon Osborne (see bibliography) finds that  "the film makes the ultrapowerful state toward which we are gradually slouching  seem a dangerous and unhappy prospect."
