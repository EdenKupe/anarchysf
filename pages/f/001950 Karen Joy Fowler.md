<em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</em> concerns the parallel experiences of two sisters, one human, the other a chimpanzee, brought up together experimentally as a psychological experiment; inevitably, it goes tragically wrong. A central character is the brother, who becomes an ALF activist. The message is strongly pro non-human animal rights. In Susan Samatar's 2020 <a href="https://www.wewillrememberfreedom.com/podcast/ogres-of-east-africa-by-sofia-samatar/">podcast interview</a> with Margaret Killjoy, Samatar uses this novel as an example of how a novelist can't predict how her work will impact on the world, but that it can unquestionably impact on herself.

<em>The Science of Herself plus</em> is another little book in the outstanding PM Press Outspoken Authors series. Reviewed by Luther Blissett for [Freedom](https://freedomnews.org.uk/book-review-the-science-of-herself/), where it's described as a "rich meal with distinct tastes."
