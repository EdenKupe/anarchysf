 Proto-sf fantastic voyage, in which a traveller arrives in Australia, to find a  utopia of hermaphrodites made possible in part because there can be no issues  based on sexual dimorphism; the traveller fits in immediately, as he too is a  hermaphrodite.
  
 <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000877/087746eo.pdf">Colin Ward</a>  described Foigny as "the first Utopian to conceive of a society without  government." The work is included among Nettlau's '<a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau">Utopies  libertaires</a>'. <a href="biblio.htm#Berneri">Berneri</a> has 17 pages on  this tale, which she describes as "an original and entertaining utopia."
