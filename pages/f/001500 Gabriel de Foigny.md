 Proto-sf fantastic voyage, in which a traveller arrives in Australia, to find a utopia of hermaphrodites made possible in part because there can be no issues based on sexual dimorphism; the traveller fits in immediately, as he too is a  hermaphrodite.

 <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000877/087746eo.pdf">Colin Ward</a> described Foigny as "the first Utopian to conceive of a society without government." The work is included among Nettlau's 'Utopies libertaires'. Berneri (see bibliography for Nettlau and Berneri) has 17 pages on this tale, which she describes as "an original and entertaining utopia." For Peter Seyferth, in his 2009 'Anarchism and Utopia,' this is one of "the first full-fledged anarchist utopias". (286)
