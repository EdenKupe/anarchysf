title: "Leslie Fish - The Weight"
---

Fan-published anarchist and feminist Star Trek novel,  now virtually unobtainable. There's much on this at <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Weight_Collected">fanlore.org</a>. The story apparently involves Kirk encountering a rocket  headed for the Moon; after making contact, he finds the crew to be a collection  of longhaired, tattooed, free-living anarchists; he himself has an affair with  one of them. There is said to be much on the cultural clash between the  anarchists and the Federation.

Fish is described as an "IWW member  and anarchist activist" in the 2014  Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary.
