 The last quarter of <em>The White Stone</em> recounts a dream of a 23rd  century collectivist utopia in a federal Europe; there remains a strong  anarchist opposition, which is generally tolerated. For Marie-Louise Berneri "Anatole  France's utopian sketch in <em>La Pierre Blanche</em> has been rightly ignored, as  it is one of his dullest pieces of writing" . . . (Berneri 1949: 293)

<em>Penguin Island</em> is  a satire involving evolution among penguins. Book Two presents an essentially anarchist view of the origin of property and government:

"Do you see, my son," he exclaimed, "that madman who with his teeth is biting the nose of the adversary he has overthrown and that other one who is pounding a woman's head with a huge stone?"

"I see them," said Bulloch. "They are creating law; they are founding property; they are establishing the principles of civilization, the basis of society, and the foundations of the State." 
(Bantam Classic edn: 37)

The last book concerns the future destruction of civilization, initiated by anarchist bombers; although the author seems to have some sympathy for this, the book concludes with the cyclical return of the triumphant State. Unusually, we have a record of the views of Bartolomeo Vanzetti on this work: for him  "France masterly slaps, in this book, the pretentions, proudness, hypocracy, stupidity and ferocity of the humane, and shows the uselessness of religions, and the venom of the clergies." (Frankfurter & Jackson, eds: 144)
