_Their Master's War_ is military sf with soldiers enslaved by aliens to fight opposing aliens. 

_Armageddon Crazy_ tells of a coup in a theocratic USA led by a fundamentalist president.

Both are recommended by Zeke Teflon at See Sharp Press, particularly in his article on <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/mick-farrens-sci-fi-novels-an-appreciation/">
Farren&#39;s sf novels</a>, but also in his lists of both <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/tag/anarchist-science-fiction/">anarchist</a> and 
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/a-few-favorite-atheist-science-fiction-novels-and-books-on-cults/">atheist</a> sf. Teflon sees Farren's work as having "an anti-authoritarian leftist political bent".
