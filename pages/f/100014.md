Escape story set in a future semi-automated  private-enterprise underground prison and an authoritarian United States  operating a draconian one child policy.
 
<a href="biblio.htm#Osborne">Jon Osborne</a> finds that  "the film makes the ultrapowerful state toward which we are gradually slouching  seem a dangerous and unhappy prospect."
