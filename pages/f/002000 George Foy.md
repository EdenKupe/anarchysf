"Governments and corporations wage war against anarchist enclaves." (Dan Clore)
 
The dense  text and opacity of the storyline tend to dilute such interest as the reader  might have in the self-contained enclaves, which are more outlaw than anarchist,  notwithstanding a passing nod in the direction of Kropotkin.
