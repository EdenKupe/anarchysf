Coming of age yarn set in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, warmly humorous, and written in Australian English, befitting the essentially anti-authoritarian Australian culture depicted. Winner of the 2023 
Prometheus Award.

The author describes himself as a "rational anarchist" in the mould of Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, and describes _Cloud-Castles_ as "a slightly more overt Minarchist/Libertarian reflection 
of my own points of view." [<a href="https://www.lfs.org/blog/the-prometheus-interview-with-dave-freer-the-2023-best-novel-winner-for-cloud-castles/">Prometheus Blog</a>]
