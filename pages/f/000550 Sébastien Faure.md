Faure was a notable French free-thinker, secularist, and proponent of anarchist communism. Prior to his co-founding, with Voline, of a 'synthesis anarchism' — a development of 'anarchism without adjectives' — he published <em>Mon Communisme</em>, his own fully-realised anarchist utopia. It's set in a near-future (as seen from 1921) France fifteen years after a revolution which in turn had not long succeeded the Great War. Travellers from Brazil are shown anarchism in action, as seen from the perspectives of a town, the country, and Paris itself, inevitably reacting with much enthusiasm.

Cohn (see bibliography) describes this work as more correctly a uchronia, because the displacement is of time rather than of place. He links it with the work of Pataud and Pouget (q.v.), as does Nettlau in his <em>Esbozo </em> (see bibliography). Berneri rather more pertinently notes that the work "had a limited appeal as a piece of sentimental propaganda."
