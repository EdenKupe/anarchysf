<em>The Theory of the Four Movements</em> is an extraordinary work of early libertarian socialism, a  mix of a penetrating critique of developing capitalism and a fanciful  quasi-prophetic visionary cosmogony. The fullest anarchist discussion is  probably that by Don LaCoss, originally published in <em>Fifth Estate</em> in  2003, and now available at <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/don-lacoss-charles-fourier-prefigures-our-total-refusal"> The Anarchist Library</a>. LaCoss gives an accurate summary of this work:

"This scheme for a revolutionary reorganization of life on  all planes of existence was the subject of his wonderfully weird first book,  Theory of the Four Movements (1808), which might be best characterized as a  combination of philosophy, cosmogony, industrial psychology, science fiction,  and prophecy. In the pages of this great utopian text, Fourier vigorously  condemned capitalist markets, bureaucratic excrescence, the oppression of women,  and suffocation of desire by the leviathans of industrial civilization.

"To address these wrongs, he proposed a complex system of  worker self-management, locally autonomous voluntary associations, and the  restoration of existential meaning to daily chores. The goal of this system was  “universal harmony,” a near-hallucinatory level of sensual creation and  gratification that would emerge from intentional communities. The paths toward  Harmony would inevitably lead to the evolutionary overcoming of industrial  capitalism: animals would learn to play musical instruments, stars will copulate  and spray us all with their sexual fluids, weather patterns will shift, new  moons will revolve around the earth, the chemical composition of the oceans  would change, and human bodies begin to mutate. 

"I suspect that Fourier may not have intended that people  read his Theory of the Four Movements as literal, instrumental prescriptions for  social change. What his book did offer, however, was a glimpse of what unleashed  passion and imagination could produce if you refused to let your mind be limited  by the existing orders of knowledge and institutions of power."

To be honest, parts of the book come across as pretty  demented, but the strength of the rest sustains the reader's interest.

The <em>Utopian Vision</em> anthology is definitely of  interest. Fourier's vision is really rather remarkable, and though by no means  conventionally utopian the future tense in which much of it is written, and the  occasional vignettes of life in his ideal society, mark it as in a sense science  fictional. Though in many ways rigidly regimented on pseudo-scientific lines,  the utopian society is depicted as joyously socialistic, antipathetic to the  work ethic, and glorying in free-range sexuality.

Max Nettlau (see bibliography) was clear on Fourier's importance: "In short, we can say that many roads led from Fourierism to libertarian socialism" . . . .

Kropotkin devoted four pages of _Modern Science and Anarchy_ to Fourier, whom he describes as "the deepest socialist thinker." (152-5)
