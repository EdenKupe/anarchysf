Bright and optimistic anthology, which has been seen as  one of the founding anthologies of solarpunk.
 
First drawn to the attention of the Facebook Anarchism and  Science Fiction Forum in 2014, with the comment "Not sure how much in here is in  the anarchist spirit, but looks promising that there could be ....." In fact  there isn't, really, but it's still worth reading.
 
Reviewed by Zeke Teflon, for whom it was only partially  successful: "Of the 16 stories and one novella, I enjoyed only the six pieces  mentioned above, disliked about an equal number, and was indifferent to the  rest." But for him the last but one story, Charlie Jane Anders's 'The Day It All  Ended,' tipped the scales, so that the anthology as a whole was recommended.
