Notable dystopian tale set in a future hyper-neoliberal Britain.

Included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">Essential Novels</a> of anarchist sf, where it's described as "definitely not anarchist and [is] very short on solutions, but it does provide a gut-wrenching depiction of the emotional and physical carnage that seems all too possible should authoritarian capitalism continue careening downhill into the neoliberal chasm." It also received a full <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/review-84k/">review</a> by Teflon in 2018, for whom it was "Highly recommended", notwithstanding some reservations.
