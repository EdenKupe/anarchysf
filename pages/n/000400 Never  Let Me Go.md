 Melancholic dystopia set in an alternate England in which life expectancy has  been extended beyond 100 by the expedient of breeding clones for their body  parts; three such clones struggle to come to terms with this, while embroiled in  a love triangle that gives them little satisfaction.

The film received a scathing <a href="https://libcom.org/article/never-let-me-go-directed-mark-romanek">review</a> by Tom Jennings in <em>Freedom</em> in 2011. For a flavour, try this: "This particular tepid, timid, subprime derivative squanders countless imaginative flourishes gesturing at twentieth-century sociopolitical governance passing from traditional aristocratic condescension to brutally psychotic consumerism."
