Story of telepathic yetis, part of which is set in Spain during the Civil War. Speaks unusually warmly of the anarchists: one character says "They were men of courage and I remember them often. Naturally they had no idea that reason and intellect would get them nowhere."(1979 NEL pb collection of the same title: 169)
