Quintessential Afrofuturism, strange and rather compelling. Enthusiastically received on the Facebook Anarchist Film Group page: for Benjamin Virnston "If an anarcha-queer afro-futurist lo-fi sci-fi hacker musical filmed in Rwanda sounds like your cup of tea, find a way to pour yourself a warm cup of this movie."
