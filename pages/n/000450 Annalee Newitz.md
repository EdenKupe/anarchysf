_Autonomous_ marks an impressive debut novel, with a 22nd century tale of autonomous robots, indentured humans, drug piracy and anti-corporate activism.

_Future of Another Timeline_ is a feminist time travel novel, in which at one point (in 1893) there's some discussion of Lucy Parsons, IWW, and _The Alarm_, as well as of Emma Goldman, and of Alexander Berkman's attentat on Henry Clay Frick; and the appended guide to Historical Sources confirms the historicity of the few pages concerned.

Both are included in the <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">Sharp and Pointed</a> list of essential anarchist sf, whose reviewer commends the second novel's "very well drawn and diverse settings, [and] well argued political/social points".
