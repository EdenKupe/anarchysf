Earth passes through the tail of a comet, reducing most of  humanity to red dust, but leaving a few zombies, some unscrupulous scientists,  and a couple of teenage girls and a boy they meet, who outwit the bad guys, with  irrepressible good humour.

In an interview copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list in  2003,  this was named by Ken Macleod as on his short list of great SF movies.
