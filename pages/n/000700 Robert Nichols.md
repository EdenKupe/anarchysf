_Daily Lives_ is a short tetralogy, set in a near-future alternate-world central Asian land. Strong on ecological and (unusually) traditional-religious values, the anarchist influence is explicitly acknowledged. Written in a fragmented, poetic and impressionistic style, it's an interesting and important modern utopia. _Daily Lives_ is preceded by an introductory work, _Red Shift_, in  which characters include 'Errico Malatesta' and 'Sandy Berkman'.

"While _Daily Lives_ is not widely  known, it is one of the most important contributions to both literary  and theoretical utopianism." (Clark 2009: 21-2) It was a significant  influence on Ursula K. Le Guin, who is on record as saying that " . . .  Nghsi-Altai is in some respects the very place I was laboriously trying  to get to, and yet lies in quite the opposite direction . . .". (Le Guin  1982)

A key treatment of this work is given in a paper published by Daniel P. Jaeckle in _Utopian Studies_ in 2013, entitled '<a href="ttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5325/utopianstudies.24.2.0264.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:b016597718812ea3744adadf19b48258&ab_segments=&origin=&acceptTC=1">The Green Anarchist Utopia of Robert Nichols's Daily Lives in Nghsi-Altai</a>'. Jaeckle's concluding statement is that "_Daily Lives in Nghsi-Altai_ remains a model of how to blend instruction and delight that over thirty years later green anarchist authors would still do well to emulate."
