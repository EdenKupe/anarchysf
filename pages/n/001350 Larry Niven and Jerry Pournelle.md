In _Lucifer's Hammer_ Earth is devastated by the impact of a comet, and survivors struggle to keep going. The novel is described as a favourite, in Hill's <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/06/12/the-libertarian-history-of-science-fiction/">Libertarian History of Science Fiction</a>.

<a href="http://www.wendymcelroy.com/comment.php?comment.news.4922">Wendy McElroy</a> describes _Oath of Fealty_ in the following terms: "Libertarians either love this book or hate it. Set in the very near future, it portrays an autonomous contractual community established in Los Angeles County, under attack by radical environmentalists." <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/politics">SFE</a> calls the novel "a particularly cleverly thought-out exercise" in the "kind of doublethink" in which "the bureaucratic organizations of the state are replaced, at least so far as the key characters are concerned, by hyperorganized command structures in which the ethic of individual freedom supposedly being upheld is chimerically bonded to ideals of slavish loyalty and self-sacrificing 'honour'".
