Features two anarchists, one a pacifist, the other a violent exponent of propaganda by the deed. Although the author has at least grasped that anarchism is about opposition to the state, and there is a relevant story element in which the pacifist is witness to an act of violence and ponders whether on not to involve the police, his knowledge is clearly minimal: he has one of the anarchists associating himself with Lenin and Trotsky, at the head of the professional revolutionaries. Meanwhile, the leader of the Anti-Political Party is elected President of the World.
