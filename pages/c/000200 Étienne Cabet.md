Icaria proves to be a communist utopia of rather an authoritarian stamp.

Peter Kropotkin was familar with the work, and criticised its authoritarianism in his 1913 _<a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781849352758/page/n177/mode/2up?view=theater&q=cabet352758/page/n177/mode/2up?view=theater&q=cabet">Modern Science and Anarchy</a>_. He declared that "With Cabet, the author of _Voyage to Icaria_ and founder of a communist colony in America, Jacobin communism and the suppression of individuality reached their fullest expression." Later in the same work he wrote "Needless to say that the government of the community was always the most serious stumbling block for all the practical communists. Indeed, you must read _Voyage to Icaria_ by Cabet to understand how detestable, impossible, were the communities founded by the Icarians. Cabet demanded the complete annihilation of the human personality before the high-priest founder. You understand the hatred that Proudhon dedicated to this whole sect! It deserved it." (148 & 219)

Berneri has sixteen pages on Cabet's utopia,  which she finds particularly uncongenial:

"Etienne Cabet belonged to that type of social reformer whose love of humanity is  as boundless as their faith in their own power to work out its salvation." (219)

"Though there are no rich and no poor in Icaria, no professional politicians and  soldiers, no policemen and no prisons, we feel strangely uncomfortable at  finding that it has so many features in common with the totalitarian régimes of  the twentieth century. [ . . . ] The love of uniformity, centralisation and  state-control is to be found in most utopias, but in _Voyage to Icaria_ it  is carried to such extremes as to make it resemble, in many parts, the satirical  utopias of our century." (235)
