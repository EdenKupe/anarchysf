Collino, who wrote as 'Ixigrec', was a militant individualist anarchist, who wrote for a number of French anarchist periodicals, and who also wrote these two science fiction works, of which the later appears not to have been translated.

<a href="https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/working-translations/ixigrec-panurge-au-pays-des-machines-1940/">'Panurge'</a> is essentially a dystopia, in which Rabelais' Panurge, having grown bored with life at the Abbey of Thélème, is tempted to visit a future of the most extreme fascist totalitarianism, and is of course utterly horrified: so much so that he eventually causes the destruction of the dystopia, but at the cost of the lives of over 40 billion inhabitants.
