Lots of action and some pretty good effects, but basically  a silly story of too many superheroes fighting each other.

The Anarcho-Geek Review's Sadie the Goat was rather more  enthusiastic with a review entitled '<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/captain-america-is-a-big-screen-anarchist-superhero-how-fucking-weird-is-that">Captain  America is a big screen anarchist superhero, how fucking weird is that</a>?',  saying "Steve's [Captain America's] perspective [ . . . ] fits nicely with an  anarchist outlook; he is fighting to keep his actions his own. He refuses to put  himself in a position of taking orders simply to avoid the possibility that he  might have to feel guilty for his own mistakes later. That’s anarchist as hell"  . . . .

Connor Owens, at solarpunkanarchists.com, gives '<a href="https://solarpunkanarchists.com/2016/04/29/a-social-anarchist-take-on-captain-america-civil-war/">A  Social Anarchist Take on Captain America: Civil War</a>', which—while still  enjoying the film—gives a rather more in-depth analysis of the film from this  perspective. And I fully concur with a key point he makes:

"Built on a legacy of slavery, imperialism, colonialism,  and ecocide, from a social anarchist perspective the best thing superheroes  could do, if they’re going to exist at all, would be to use their enhanced  abilities to help inspire a planetary popular uprising against  capitalist-statism—then use their powers constructively to help build a  post-scarcity economy of the commons. This would effectively eliminate about 90%  of the things they beat people up for."
