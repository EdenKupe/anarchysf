It has been said that Čapek had to leave school "when it  was discovered that he was a member of a secret anarchist society". (<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2507200096.html">Gale</a>)  He has also been quoted as saying (but at what date is unknown) "I think I am  slowly becoming an anarchist, that this is only another label for my privateness,  and I think that you will understand this in the sense of being against  collectivity." (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Karel_Čapek">Wikiquote</a>)

Berneri, Read, and Woodcock were all familiar with  <em>R.U.R.</em>, in which the word 'robot' first became common parlance. Read felt that  maybe the robot "is no longer an appropriate symbol for an age of automation.  Capek saw men transformed into a machine; we see machines transformed into men."  (Read 1966)

Čapek's satiric novel _War with the Newts_ ridicules  Nazi-Germany and fascism in general, while conveying the author's ideas that  technology can become a threat to mankind and that capitalism unrestrained also  poses a serious danger.
