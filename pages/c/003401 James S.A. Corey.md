_The Expanse_ is a series of novels which was written by James S.A. Corey (the pen name of Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham) but also adapted into a TV series by the writers.

The Outer Planets Alliance faction from _The Expanse_ features about as much explicit anarchism as you can get past TV censors or in a Hugo-prize-winning series. The OPA logo in the show is literally the circle-A (or rather the "bisected circle" in the books). The larger backdrop of the series features anti-colonialism and syndicalism in the context of humankind's first steps in settling the outer solar system, alongside stark class warfare, as the richer "inner planets" exploit the "belters", those working in the outer solar system.

For a space-opera, it's also surprisingly far on the "hard" side of the science-fiction hardness scale; with amazing attention to realism and scientific detail in physics and engineering, but also in fields like linguistics, sociology and political theory. While there are plenty of protagonists who aren't anarchists, the good of the commonwealth is often set above and in conflict with the good of individuals or of governments. Earth in particular is a not-too-exaggerated version of our society, where wealth, resource scarcity, and corruption keep a docile population suffocating in opulence.
