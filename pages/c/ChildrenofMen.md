title: "Alfonso Cuarón - Children of Men"
---

Set in England in 2027, two decades of human infertility  have left society on the brink of collapse, with illegal migrants corralled in  camps. Miraculously, a 'fugee' is found to be pregnant, and is helped to find  sanctuary with the 'Human Project'.
 
The film was reviewed by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140428042715/http:/www.tomjennings.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/SlouchingBexhillem.html"> Tom Jennings</a> in Freedom when it came out, in typically acerbic  manner. While finding the set design and cinematography "magnificent", and the  action sequences "superb", he concludes:
 
So, opposition to the fascist state from the urban  guerrilla 'Fishes' [ . . . ] signposts the messianic underbelly of moral  politics. This rainbow coalition of former anti-war, civil rights and green  activists is riven with 'broad front' contradictions—only demanding human rights  for refugees; yet launching armed insurrection! Utterly lacking the  sociopolitical underpinnings to wring interesting speculation from its  pandemic/police state scenario, Children of Men's naff nativity parable  crumbles into faith in scientific progress—the mythical 'Human Project' run by  "the best brains in the world" on the good ship Tomorrow. [ . . . ] The  redemptive convergence of rationalist wishful-thinking with pseudo-religious  ethical superiority, promising salvation from the jackboot, is instead its  shoehorn—with the blind liberal management of capitalism actively fostering  disaster. Theo's death delivering (Black refugee) madonna and (female) child to  safety then merely finesses the conclusion that middle-class heroism (physical  or philosophical)—like this film—can suggest no solutions.
But for <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/children-of-men-10-years-clare-hope-ashitey-interview-president-trump-1201746204/"> David Ehrlich</a> at IndieWire, ten years after its release Children of Men  has become not only the "best and bleakest sci-fi movie of the 21st Century",  but also the most prescient: "Children of Men may be set in 2027, but  when Donald J. Trump was elected President of the United States, it suddenly  became clear that its time had come."
