Holley Cantine was an anarchist activist, and editor of <em>Retort</em> magazine from 1942 to 1951. Later, as well as translating the Russian 
anarchist Voline’s multivolume account of the degeneration of the Russian revolution, he wrote a little radical science fiction. This particular short 
story is an allegory of how power corrupts, but its premise is magic rather than science. First published in _Fantasy and Science Fiction_ magazine, it was 
republished in <em>The Match!</em> in 1987, and in <em>Communicating Vessels</em> in 2010. Much more info on Cantine may be found at
