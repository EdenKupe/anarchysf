So much a part of our cultural heritage that for years I  didn't include it in this listing. But it has been as familiar to anarchists as  to other readers, and was commented on by, for instance, Alex Comfort, Herbert  Read, and George Woodcock.

The poet W.H. Auden considered Wonderland to  be "a place of complete anarchy" (Auden 1962: 35).
