_Invisible Cities_ is not sf, but was nominated for a Nebula award in 1975, and merits mention in <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/calvino_italo">SFE</a>. Seen as a postmodern novel, it's presented as a conversation between Marco Polo and 
Kublai Khan, in a series of 55 brief prose poems describing as many fictitious cities. Three pages of extracts were printed in _<a href="https://greenanarchy.anarchyplanet.org/files/2012/05/greenanarchy24.pdf">Green Anarchy</a>_ in May 2012.

_If on a winter's night . . ._ is also not sf, but as <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/calvino_italo">SFE</a> puts it  this novel "stunningly transfigures the conventions and momentums of narrative  into a Bunuelesque labyrinth", and Calvino's "use of SF subjects and their  intermixing with a whole array of contemporary literary devices made him a  figure of considerable interest for the future of the genre."

Calvino wrote, of his father, that he "had been in his  youth an anarchist, a follower of Kropotkin and then a Socialist Reformist".
