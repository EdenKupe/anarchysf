---

A teenage thug in a a dystopian near-future  Britain is cured of his violent ways by aversion therapy, the moral  being an inversion of the Frankenstein story, namely that it is as  wrong to unmake a monster, by taking away his free will, as to make  one. Aurally and visually intense, and challenging to watch.
