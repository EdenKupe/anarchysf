Ecotopia drew mixed responses from anarchists. For Lessa, Takver & Alyx  it was "an environmentalist's dream come true", but for Milligan "Ecotopia is a  shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav  workers' co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of Blueprint for  Survival. [ . . . ] Ecotopia is a flawed vision of a flawed future." For A.B.  "This is an important book which should not be taken seriously", but is  "unconvincing on the political plane".
 Â 
 Ecotopia Emerging is the prequel, setting the scene for  the first novel. It is tagged as SF in the <a href="http://www.cira.ch/catalogue/index.php?lvl=categ_see&amp;id=346&amp;main="> CIRA</a> catalogue, as well as being included in the  Red Planets reading list.
