title: "Alex Comfort - Come Out to Play"
---

Comfort—renowned sexologist and gerontologist—was at one time better known as an anarchist. Come Out to Play concerns the discovery of a sexually-liberating drug, and the havoc it wreaks on an uptight society. It's not explicitly anarchist, though it tends that way.

Harold Drasdo, discussing Comfort's work in Anarchy in November 1963, wrote:

Humour is a notoriously erratic weapon but most readers without insuperable sexual barriers ought to enjoy this book thoroughly. [ . . . ] it presents serious and humane ideas about sexual and personal relationships and about modern science and politics." (Drasdo: 352)

The Philosophers tells of a (then) near-future Britain in which a group of intellectuals successfully crash the City financial system. Goodway has a chapter on Alex Comfort, describing this novel "of cyber-terrorists employing non-violent dirty tricks" as "a return to the advocacy of forming a Maquis to resist the 'Occupying Power', although that was by now Thatcherism," and showing that Comfort's "combativity and subversiveness" was unchanged.
