George Woodcock, discussing Orwell's view on nationalism  in 1966, used <em>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</em> as the extreme example of how  local patriotism could be, when ". . . every parish is its own patria"  (p203). This work of Conservative romanticism has a degree of charm that may  appeal, but is really of only slight interest for anarchists. It may have been  more than chance that suggested this comparison to Woodcock, as <em>Napoleon</em>  is set in 1984.

<em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em> is included  here on the strength of Brian Aldiss's comment (in <em>Billion Year Spree</em>,  1973) that it is "Not science fiction, perhaps, yet nearer to science and  rationality than the science fantasy which is the hallmark of the period."

Jack Robinson, in <em>Freedom</em> in 1977,  described this work as "a parable . . . in which the anarchist gang all turn out  to be policemen (not so improbable) but this idea evaporated in gaseous Catholic  mystic flummery." John Quail, in his 1978 history of British anarchism, <em>The Slow-Burning Fuse</em>, referred to it as a variation of a stereotype developed  in the 1890s. Although the novel is entirely about anarchists, not a single  character actually is one, so it's particularly unjust that the book has become  one of the sources of the stock anarchist slander. Chesterton's only authorial  comment on real anarchists comes in chapter IV where, speaking of Syme  ('Thursday') he writes that "He did not regard anarchists, as most of us do, as  a handful of morbid men, combining ignorance with intellectualism." It is an  entertaining novel, but basically rubbish.
