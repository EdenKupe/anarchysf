Kafkaesque allegory of a group of people who mysteriously  find themselves trapped within industrialized cubic rooms, with hatchways on all  six faces leading into similar rooms, some being rigged with lethal traps, and  all apparently contained within another vast cube, within which the compartments  move about.

For Mark Bould, in his _Red Planets_ filmography (see bibliography), the "Eponymous  device models the logic of capital for those trapped within it."

Facebook's Sci-Fi Libertarian Socialist, in August 2016,  described this film as "Easily one of the best low-budget sci-fi flicks out  there."
