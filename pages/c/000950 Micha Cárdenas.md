Short novel, described in a foreword by adrienne maree brown as "A work of alternate universes and love between trans women, a remarkably tender story of abolition and antifascism&quot;; the antifascism relates very directly to the election of a fascist President of the United States, which seems to resonate very strongly in the final months of 2024. There is a long and perceptive review at _<a href="http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/atoms-never-touch-by-micha-cardenas/">Strange Horizons_</a>, which notes in particular that it's "a great fit for anarchist publishing house AK Press and its Emergent Strategy Series."
