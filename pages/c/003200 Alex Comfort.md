Comfort—renowned sexologist and gerontologist—was at one time better known as an anarchist. _Come Out to Play_ concerns the discovery of a sexually-liberating drug, and the havoc it wreaks on an uptight society. It's not explicitly anarchist, though it tends that way.

Harold Drasdo, discussing Comfort's work in _Anarchy_ in November 1963, wrote:

Humour is a notoriously erratic weapon but most readers without insuperable sexual barriers ought to enjoy this book thoroughly. [ . . . ] it presents serious and humane ideas about sexual and personal relationships and about modern science and politics." (Drasdo: 352)

_The Philosophers_ tells of a (then) near-future Britain in which a group of intellectuals successfully crash the City financial system. Goodway (see bibliography) has a chapter on Alex Comfort, describing this novel "of cyber-terrorists employing non-violent dirty tricks" as "a return to the advocacy of forming a Maquis to resist the 'Occupying Power', although that was by now Thatcherism," and showing that Comfort's "combativity and subversiveness" was unchanged.
