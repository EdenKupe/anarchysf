Comfort — renowned sexologist and gerontologist — was at one time better known as an anarchist. _Come Out to Play_ concerns the discovery of a sexually-liberating drug, and the havoc it wreaks on an uptight society. It's not explicitly anarchist, though it tends that way. The novel is discussed in Eric Laursen's 2023 biography _Polymath. The Life and Professions of Dr Alex Comfort, Author of The Joy of Sex_, saying that in it "he aimed to encourage a cultural uprising, spiked with satire against the enemies of a sane society rather than a direct political assault"; he says that, although dated, "the novel remains entertaining because the spectacle of buffoonish bigwigs taken down to a human level always amuses." (pp283/4)

Harold Drasdo, discussing Comfort's work in _Anarchy_ in November 1963, wrote that "Humour is a notoriously erratic weapon but most readers without insuperable sexual barriers ought to enjoy this book thoroughly. [ . . . ] it presents serious and humane ideas about sexual and personal relationships and about modern science and politics." (Drasdo: 352)

_The Philosophers_ tells of a (then) near-future Britain in which a group of intellectuals successfully crash the City financial system. Goodway (see bibliography) has a chapter on Alex Comfort, describing this novel "of cyber-terrorists employing non-violent dirty tricks" as "a return to the advocacy of forming a Maquis to resist the 'Occupying Power', although that was by now Thatcherism," and showing that Comfort's "combativity and subversiveness" was unchanged. (p259) Laursen observes that "the story is wish fulfillment: Alex's vision of how a corrupt and inhuman regime could be overthrown by clever, nonviolent people leveraging their enemies' greed against them, skipping class war, bloody revolution, and the power struggles that typically follow." (p584)

Comfort's early play _Cities of the Plain_ isn't mentioned by Goodway, but is usefully discussed by <a href="https://richardawarren.wordpress.com/tag/anarchism/">Richard Warren</a>. Although described by <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/comfort_alex">SFE</a> as "an anti-capitalist dystopian play", it's not really describable as sf, more as allegory, notwithstanding its author's strict advance repudiation of "all the ideological constructions, of whatever complexion . . . placed upon this play." Laursen, in his 2023 biography, notes that "The play provides the first hint that Alex's politics was leaning in the direction of anarchism" (p65).

_Tetrarch_ is a fantasy, of no great interest, although Laursen, who devotes two pages to it, describes one of the four realms as "a kind of anarchist paradise" (p531).
