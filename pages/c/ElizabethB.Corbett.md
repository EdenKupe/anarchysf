title: "Elizabeth B. Corbett - New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future"
---

New Amazonia was reviewed, briefly and scornfully,  by an anonymous writer for Commonweal in its anarchist phase, in 1890. It  is a feminist utopia, set in Ireland in 2472; domestic service still exists, but  servants are state-trained; the museum has on exhibition "an instrument of  torture . . . called a corset" (Tower edn: 44); and so onâ€”all rather quaint.
