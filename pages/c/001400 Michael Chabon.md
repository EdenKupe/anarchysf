<em>Kavalier & Clay </em>isn't sf, but superhero comic books are centre stage to the novel, set in the so-called Golden Age of the genre. Endorsed by <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/05/books-that-ursula-k-le-guin-likes-and-wants-you-to-read.html"> Ursula Le Guin</a>, who in 2007 wrote 

". . . if you haven't read _Kavalier and Clay_ yet, go read it at once, what on earth have you been waiting for?"

<em>The Yiddish Policemen's Union</em> is noted by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/c-j-sansoms-alternate-history-and-mystery-novels/"> Teflon</a> as a "fine alternate history novel". Recommended by <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/05/books-that-ursula-k-le-guin-likes-and-wants-you-to-read.html"> Ursula Le Guin</a> as "Crazy like a genius."
