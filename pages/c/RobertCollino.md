Collino, who wrote as 'Ixigrec', was a militant individualist anarchist, who wrote for a number of French anarchist periodicals, and who also wrote these two science fiction works, which appear not to have been translated, and indeed seem to be impossible to find even in French.

Noted in the 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary; and see also the [Ephéméride Anarchiste](https://www.ephemanar.net/mai03.html).
