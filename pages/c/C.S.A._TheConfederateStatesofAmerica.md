Effective mockumentary, purporting to be a cable-TV-style  account—complete with fake archive footage and even commercial breaks—of the  alternate history of the establishment of a Confederate empire across most of  the Americas, where slavery has remained the norm until the present day, after  Confederate victory in the American Civil War.

The film was one of those <a href="http://www.c-ville.com/militant-anarchist-joe-jordan-curates-black-history-month-film-series/#.WPsdmca1uUl"> selected</a> by Joe Jordan, of Anarchist People of Color, for inclusion in  events for black history month in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2013.
