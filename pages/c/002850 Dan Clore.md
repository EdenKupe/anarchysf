Dan Clore published online a list of '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090319164931/http:/www.nolanchart.com/article4700.html">Anarchist & Libertarian Socialist Societies in Utopian & Science Fiction</a>' as early as 2001, and a revised version as '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090319164931/http:/www.nolanchart.com/article4700.html">Essential 
Science Fiction and Fantasy for Libertarians'</a> in 2008. His first listing predated Ben Beck's, of 2005, but the most comprehensive listing is now that 
developed from Ben's, at <a href="https://www.anarchysf.com/">anarchySF.com</a>.

Dan is a writer, and gives his interests as 1) literature, especially weird fantasy, and 2) anarchism/libertarianism and related activism. He has an active <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dan.clore">Facebook page</a>, as well as an FB group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/617024874990524/">SMYGO (Anarchism &amp; Non-Euclidean Politics)</a>.
