In _The World in Winter_ Europeans retreat to Africa at the onset of a new ice age. Arthur W. Uloth, writing in _Anarchy_, suggested that  the survival of this novel's leading characters is sufficiently improbable (as  whites who deserve a come-uppance), as to verge on racism on the part of the  author.

_The Lotus Caves_, a juvenile, concerns  the discovery by two boys of an exotic world of alien life beneath the surface  of the moon. Colin Ward, in his 1974 educational book on utopias, used the  drabness of existence in the moon colony to demonstrate that even escape to  other worlds can't ensure the attainment of utopia. Seemingly this example was  selected at random, as it doesn't seem particularly pertinent.
