title: "Italo Calvino - If on a winter's night a traveller"
---

Not sf, but as  SFE puts it  this novel "stunningly transfigures the conventions and momentums of narrative  into a Bunuelesque labyrinth", and Calvino's "use of SF subjects and their  intermixing with a whole array of contemporary literary devices made him a  figure of considerable interest for the future of the genre."

Calvino wrote, of his father, that he "had been in his  youth an anarchist, a follower of Kropotkin and then a Socialist Reformist".
