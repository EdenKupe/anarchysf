Explores an attractive anarchist society in a post-collapse 22nd  century San Francisco. Anu Bonobo, in <a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/370-fall-2005/after-the-deluge-processed-world/">Fifth Estate</a>,  described it as "more an imaginary treasure map than  utopia-by-the-numbers blueprint . . .". Carlsson, in the acknowledgments,  depicts the novel simply: "a stab at describing the world I'd like to wake up  into."

<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/ilcea/4454">Peter Seyferth</a>, in 2018, devoted a long paragraph to this novel, noting that "<em>After the Deluge</em> is remarkable because it mixes the two typical perspectives of utopias and dystopias: on the one hand, there is a utopian traveller, Eric, who visits San Francisco, settles down and brims over with enthusiasm for the way things are there—he becomes not only a convert, but even something like an anarchist policeman that wants to protect San Francisco from terrorist attacks. On the other hand, there is the dystopian inhabitant, Nwin, who grew up in San Francisco and hates it. He dreams of the ‘real freedom’ that, as he supposes, can be found in the ideas of the Reagan-Pinochet-Army he wants 
to join. He is the terrorist arsonist, Eric's adversary. While reading <em>After the Deluge</em>, one can understand both, although the positively utopian Eric is more likeable."
