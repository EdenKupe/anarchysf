 <em>Ecotopia</em> drew mixed responses from anarchists. For Lessa, Takver & Alyx  it was "an environmentalist's dream come true", but for Milligan "Ecotopia is a  shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav  workers' co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of Blueprint for  Survival. [ . . . ] Ecotopia is a flawed vision of a flawed future." For A.B.  "This is an important book which should not be taken seriously", but is  "unconvincing on the political plane". In October 2024, writing in Graswurzelrevolution, Maurice Schuhmann concluded that "Even today, this ecofiction reads a very inspiring way." ["Auch heute liest sich diese Ökofiktion sehr inspirierend."]

<em>Ecotopia Emerging</em> is the prequel, setting the scene for  the first novel. It received an adverse review by E.B. Maple (Peter Werbe) in _Fifth Estate_ #311, 1983, for whom its prose was "wooden" and its politics "unpalatable", concluding "I told a friend that if you are willing to suspend your normal criticality, swallow the West Coast myth in its entirety, and have your sense of reality defied, the book is worth reading just to see the good guys beat the bad guys for once. His response, “Why bother?” A good question."

Maxwell Schnurer and Laura K. Hahn, more generously, gave the view that "Callenbach's stories act as a shared reference, and an opportunity for political mobilization based on mutual understanding where we live. (Amster et al., 2009, _Contemporary Anarchist Studies_: 149)
