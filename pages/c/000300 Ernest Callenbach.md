 <em>Ecotopia</em> drew mixed responses from anarchists. For Lessa, Takver & Alyx  it was "an environmentalist's dream come true", but for Milligan "Ecotopia is a  shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav  workers' co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of Blueprint for  Survival. [ . . . ] Ecotopia is a flawed vision of a flawed future." For A.B.  "This is an important book which should not be taken seriously", but is  "unconvincing on the political plane". In October 2024, writing in Graswurzelrevolution, Maurice Schuhmann concluded that "Even today, this ecofiction reads a very inspiring way." ["Auch heute liest sich diese Ökofiktion sehr inspirierend."]

<em>Ecotopia Emerging</em> is the prequel, setting the scene for  the first novel. It is tagged as SF in the <a href="http://www.cira.ch/catalogue/index.php?lvl=categ_see&amp;id=346&amp;main="> CIRA</a> catalogue, as well as being included in the _Red Planets_ reading list (see Bould, in bibliography).
