_The Saint of Bright Doors_ is a well-received fantasy novel, not actually sf by any definition recognised here, but listed because it was the subject of one of the accompanying <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/anarchysf/episodes/Grounding-ourselves-in-Saint-of-Bright-Doors-e2k41fs/a-aba5n1e">anarchysf</a> podcasts. It was also reviewed by Joseph-Kass Tomaras in _The Anarchist Review of Books_ #8.

_Rakesfall_, which I struggle to characterise as sf, won the 2025 Ursula K. Le Guin prize for fiction. The author, on his website, says "_Rakesfall_ is a book about power, and it talks about the arrogance and undeserved self-belief of the powerful, their bottomless desire for more power, more wealth, until they shamelessly strive for not only a throne but godhood. This is in fact the world we already live in, which is why our oligarchs are obsessed with longevity, AI, and transcending mere humanity."
