_New Amazonia_ was reviewed, briefly and scornfully,  by an anonymous writer for _Commonweal_ in its anarchist phase, in 1890. It  is a feminist utopia, set in Ireland in 2472; domestic service still exists, but  servants are state-trained; the museum has on exhibition "an instrument of  torture . . . called a corset" (Tower edn: 44); and so on—all rather quaint.

<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2019/07/world-without-men">Lyta Gold</a>, in _Current Affairs_ in 2019, drew attention to the novel's "extra-heavy embrace of eugenics and surprisingly dark ending," finding _New Amazonia_ "a particularly curious example of feminist utopian literature."
