Thematic four book quartet.  _Love and War_ and _No Future_ portray anarchists in the form of neo-pagan anarchist travellers in an interstellar travel era  and a Black Star militant group (described in _No Future_ as "probably  remnants of the Angry Brigade") in the background of a possibly alternate version of the 1976 London milieu. These portray anarchists favourably. Part of the DOCTOR WHO New Adventures sequence. (mailing to anarchysf)
