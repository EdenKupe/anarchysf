_The Rise of the Meritocracy_ takes the form  of a report on the subject written by a historical sociologist in 2033. The narrator fully supports the meritocratic system, the author tacitly does not; this results in the case for meritocracy being well-presented, the case against only as well supplied as the reader can imagine unaided. Thus as a dystopia (as which it is intended) it is perhaps over-subtle.

It was reviewed at some length in _Freedom_ in 1959, raising  for Norman Rush the question

"Under what conditions does natural excellence serve the species, and not rise  into a hostile and dangerous agency? A human answer can only be elaborated out  of libertarian devices—the division of labour in time, the mixture of species of  work, territorial contraction of authority and rotation in office, new engines  of democratic initiative and appeal, competition in excellence and benefit. Is  there any course open to egalitarians other than beginning at once, outside  politics, with serious demonstrations in work, education, and leisure of the  possibilities of a free and reasonable life?"

Young had only recently died at the time Colin Ward and David Goodway's _Talking Anarchy_ was first published. This prompted four pages on Young and  his most famous work. Ward paraphrased Young as reflecting, in a 2001 _Guardian_ <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment"> article</a>, that "Too much of what I predicted has become horribly true". The  authors also drew attention to Young's other significant activity in Britain, as  the initiator of organisations such as the Consumers' Association, the Advisory  Centre for Education, and the Mutual Aid Society. Young's political beliefs were  socialist, not anarchist, and in 1978 he accepted a life peerage.

Sophie Scott-Brown, in her 2023 _Colin Ward and the Art of Everyday Anarchy_, notes surprise that Young's novel didn't draw Ward's attention: "This was an odd omission because at the heart of Young's work, as much as his own, was an attempt to think through the tension between 'merit', a cold calculation of 'effort plus IQ' which both men equated with welfarist philosophy, and 'kinship', the organic webs of social relations that sustained individuals through trial, triumph, and tragedy. It was possible that Ward, at this time, simply considered him 'too Labour' [ . . . ]". (100)
