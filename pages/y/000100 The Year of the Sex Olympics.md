A future in which lowest common denominator TV is used to  distract the mass audience, the slogan being 'Watch, Not Do!' Wooden acting and  clunky direction in a low-budget BBC production, only redeemed by its prescient  anticipation of reality TV.

Included in Mark Bould's _Red Planets_ filmography.
