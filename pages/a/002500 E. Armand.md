This short story, published in <em>Freedom</em> in  two parts in March and April 1935, recounts a dream of a prisoner at the bar  defending his throwing a bomb at an Anarchist Committee in the 1980s. He did it  to attack the hypocrisy of those who profess anarchism but fail to live as  anarchists. A moral tale, it just scrapes in here as, by its future setting,  marginal sf.
