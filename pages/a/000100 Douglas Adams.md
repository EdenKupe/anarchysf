Notably, David Graeber discusses the first two books in the series (_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ and _The Restaurant at the End of the Universe_) in his _Bullshit Jobs_. In particular, he focuses on Adams's satirical representation of telephone sanitizers, hairdressers, advertising executives, and second-hand car salesmen, questioning the degree to which these are indeed bullshit jobs. He says:

"I have no particular bone to pick with Douglas Adams; in fact, I have a fondness for all manifestations of humorous British seventies sci-fi; but nonetheless, I find this particular fantasy alarmingly condescending. First of all, the list is not really a list of useless professions at all. It’s a list of the sort of people a middle-class bohemian living in Islington around that time would find mildly annoying."

In its irreverence of authority and its absurdism, <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> can certainly hold interest for the anarchist reader. Within its pages, it seems that no hierarchy, no political structure, no matter how big or small, doesn't hold some form of corruption within it. Whether the crass and brutal lack of empathy of the Vogons, the mind-numbing bureaucracy of local, municipal government, or the start-system encompassing absurdism of the galactic governance, all the systems in these books are a mockery of rigid, segmented power-structures and their traps.

In their place, individual empathy, perseverance and ingenuity are often suggested or expanded upon. However, it should be noted that, as part of its satirical voice, there are no firm political alternatives suggested within the series. The fact that it's very good more than makes up for that.
