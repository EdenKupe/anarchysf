_The Handmaid's Tale_ is included in Zeke Teflon's <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>, though he describes it as "More  speculative social fiction than science fiction." <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/">Zakk Flash</a>, on the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, considers it a "Wonderful, wonderful book."

Jesse Cohn, in his 2024 _Hot Equations_, draws attention to how controversy over this novel "underlines just how much assertive force a _novum_ has: by projecting forced reproductive labor and sexual slavery into the future, imagined in the form of a 'dystopia,' and particularly, as Arrianna Planey points out, by imagining this dystopian regime as governing white women's bodies _only_, Atwood obscured the very 
'empirical reality' that Black women have actually experienced in the very country in which Atwood's novel is set."

_Oryx and Crake_ is included in the <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">See Sharp Press list</a> of essential anarchist sf, where it's described as "An all too plausible, very well written look at the possible horrors of genetic engineering warped by profit-at-any-price corporate capitalism in a class-stratified, repressive sociopolitical system."

_The Year of the Flood_ is the first of two sequels to _Oryx and Crake_, and is also included in the <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">See Sharp Press list</a>.

_Maddaddam_ concludes the trilogy. Unusually, this book has received contrasting treatment by two of the See Sharp Press reviewers: <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/review-maddaddam/">Nicholas P. Oakley</a> finds it tends towards the derivative, and its thin plot "turns downright silly by the end." He concludes "In the trilogy’s two previous instalments, Atwood managed to walk the tightrope between mainstream engagement and genre fiction tropes by creating compelling characters in an interesting world, but by _Maddaddam_ the plot spaghetti and flood of Big Ideas combine to make a disappointing end." Zeke Teflon, however, compiler of their <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">list</a> of essential anarchist sf, is enthusiastic about all three volumes, saying that _Maddaddam_ is "Just as engrossing as the previous two books, it adds a fair bit of material on the sleaziness and hypocrisy of fundamentalist religion, and much more on the extreme measures necessary to avoiding detection in a nearly all-seeing surveillance society." I side with Oakley on this.

In his 2022 <a href="https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/utopianstudiessocietyconf22/book-of-abstracts-2/">
paper</a> Javier Álvarez Caballero takes the view that the trilogy as a whole shows that "there is a synergy between the concepts of Eco-anarquism and Posthumanism, stating that they need to coexist in order to be fulfilled, being this combination the only way to achieve Utopia. No society can call itself posthuman if it is not eco-anarquist, and viceversa."
