Ferocious scary alien stalks and  kills the crew of a spaceship.

Categorised as subversive by  Glenn in his 2015 essay 'Film as Subversion', in the _BASTARD Chronicles_.  In his view, "The real horror of the film was not the multi-mandibled,  slathering lizard, it was discovering that the crew's bosses  intentionally sent them to collect the alien and then serve as its  meal for the journey home, forcing the viewer to reevaluate his  relationship with his own employers."

Three contributors to the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>, in November 2016, listed  this film as among the best SF ever committed to film.
