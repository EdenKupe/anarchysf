The Anarchist Library</a>. Gillis begins by stating categorically "that <em>Arrival</em> is the best Science Fiction film ever made." He continues, that "Thereâ€™s an old bit Science Fiction fans like to tell about Mary Shelley, the first formal science fiction author, being the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, in turn often cited as the first formal feminist and anarchist. <em>Arrival</em> is very clearly and solidly in this tradition. Empathy and science are centered as heroic, the film is positively riven with the humming absence of all the violent hierarchical aspects normalized in almost all other film, and the 'enemy' insofar as there is one, is the confusion such modes of existence bring."
