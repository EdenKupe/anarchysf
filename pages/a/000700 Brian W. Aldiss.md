"There is Brian Aldiss with his <em>Barefoot in the Head</em> vision of an LSD 'bombed' Europe almost totally liberated and developing bizarre  new customs." (Moorcock 1978) There was an interesting exchange concerning  the book in <em>Foundation</em> in 1976, between Peter Nicholls and Brian Aldiss. Nicholls felt that, while it is "not fair to say that the novel preaches  anarchy, . . . it certainly accepts it", and that it is "somehow more anarchic  than one believes Aldiss to be." (Nicholls 1976: 34, 35). Aldiss's reply, in a  letter in the following issue, exclaimed indignantly that " . . . the novel is  about anarchy; but why claim that I therefore espouse it? Don't I make it look  nasty enough?" (Aldiss 1976: 48).

Vittorio Curtoni in 1978 singled out the  other three titles, probably for the sole reason that they existed in Italian  translation; he described them as "inspired parables", modelled with the tools  of psychoanalysis (Curtoni 25). <em>Earthworks</em> is an Aldiss potboiler, of  minimal interest; 'Down the Up Escalator' is a minor work in which a publisher's  sickness is paralleled with the Vietnam war; and <em>Intangibles, Inc.</em> is a  good collection of five stories (Curtoni may only have been referring to the  title story; it has no special relevance, however).
