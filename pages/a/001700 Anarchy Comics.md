Just four issues were published, but all are still entertaining. There are comic  strips with SF content in three of the four, most notably by Paul Mavrides and  Jay Kinney.

In 1981 #3 received a long and enthusiastic review by <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Freedom-1981-09-12.pdf"> Cliff Harper</a>, for whom this issue was "the best one so far." He further  said:

"'Anarchy Comix', over its 3 years existence has reached a readership that in  numbers outstrips that of the US and English anarchist press together, and  what's more most of these readers are not already committed to anarchist or  radical perspectives. So 'Anarchy Comix' must be seen as a major success in  anarchist propaganda and in anarchist art. I believe the main reason for this  success is that it is a visual form, relying not on endless words and dry  theory, but rather on pictures (and humour)."

Harper had earlier <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Freedom-1980-03-29.pdf"> reviewed</a> #2 in 1980.
