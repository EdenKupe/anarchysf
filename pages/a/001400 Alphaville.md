French New Wave pulp sf, but shot in black  and white in a hard-boiled film noir style, with a surrealist streak. An  intergalactic secret agent goes to Alphaville, a city run by a computer busy  eradicating emotion from its occupants, defeats the computer's logic, kills its  creator, and departs with the latter's daughter. Plenty of thoughtful dialogue  along the way.

Described in _Red Planets_ (see Bould, in bibliography) as a "Dystopian satire on  bureaucracy and commodification, betraying a genuine affection for popular  culture.
