Drilling workers are sent by NASA to deflect  an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, their mission being to bury a  nuclear device deep enough to blow the asteroid apart.

Jon Osborne (see bibliography) includes a review of this film, saying:
Â 
There are several aspects of this story that  will appeal to libertarians. First, it has something of the creator-as-hero  theme. [. . .] Second, there are numerous small conflicts between his skilled  workers and their government handlers, in which the workers are always right. [.  . .] And finally, when the team agrees to save the planet, the chief  compensation they demand is that they be free of taxation for the rest of their  lives!
