Classic anime, set in a post-World War III Neo-Tokyo, featuring a teenage biker who develops special psychic powers and eventually liberates the imprisoned Akira, also a psychic, who had been blamed for the war.

In a comment on a <a href="http://www.madmind.de/2010/08/03/the-role-of-kaori-in-akira/">blog</a> about <em>Akira</em>, John Wiberg said "<em>Akira</em>, to me at least, has always been about power and oppression (It is in essence a highly political film; something rarely discussed considering the film features anarchist revolutionaries, greedy officials dying clutching money and a riot being suppressed by military police). Alex Fitch at <a href="http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/reviews/2011/06/30/akira/"> Electric Sheep</a> notes, too, that "it is only the interaction of the super-powered with ordinary, albeit anarchist, humans that stops the (complete) destruction of Tokyo for a third time."
