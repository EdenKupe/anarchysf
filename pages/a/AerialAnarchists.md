15 minute short featuring an airship attack on London. Believed to have been based on Fawcett's Hartmann the Anarchist. No footage is known to survive. For <a href="biblio.htm#Shaw">Tony Shaw</a>, the film "can be seen as early evidence of film-makers' ability to marry terrorism with images of mass destruction."

Included in the CIRA <a href="biblio.htm#CIRA">filmography</a>.
