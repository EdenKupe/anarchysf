title: "Paul Johansson - Atlas  Shrugged: Part I"

Adaptation of the 1957 Ayn Rand novel; parts II and III  were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively.
 
 <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/03/11/atlas-shrugged-is-a-the-movie"> Brian Doherty</a>, of Reason magazine, noted that while "the early  reactions from Randians has been positive, with adulation from Rand’s closest  friends and disciples during the years she wrote Atlas", by the same  token, "some people who don’t care for Rand have also hated the film." This is  entirely to be expected, given the way Rand divides opinion. I suspect that many  readers of this page will be in the latter camp.
