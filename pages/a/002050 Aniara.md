Swedish film adaptation of Harry Martinson's <a href="../m/001406 Harry Martinson.md">epic poem</a> of the same name. A whole <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/anarchysf/episodes/Aniara-also-Carries-Ruin-Within-eniesg"> episode</a> of the anarchySF podcast was devoted to this bleak film, which Eden Kupermintz found "very depressing, both in content and in atmosphere", though he liked its ambiguity.
