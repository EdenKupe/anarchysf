Superior exemplar of the New Weird, visually very impressive, though the story (based on the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer) is quite reminiscent of Tarkovsky's _Solaris_ and _Stalker_.

Recommended by Facebook's Solarpunk Anarchist, who said of it that "It's not solarpunk, but it is a fascinating case of ecological science-fiction with a distinctly non-anthropocentric take on its material." The film is also touched on in the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Annihilation--Discussions-of-Bodies-Being-Morphed-empmke">anarchysf podcast</a> centring on the VanderMeer novel.
