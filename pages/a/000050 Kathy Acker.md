Fairly indigestible, cyberpunk-influenced, near-future scenario—questionably worth the effort. Acker's relationship with anarchism is discussed in Diana Fare's 2002 PhD thesis 'The Edges of the Unsaid: Transgressive Practices in the Fiction of Kathy Acker', downloadable from <a href="http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&uin=uk.bl.ethos.247621">EThOS</a>. According to British anarchist Ian Bone, on his Facebook page, Acker once sent _Class War_ a cheque for £50, which funded an issue of the paper.
