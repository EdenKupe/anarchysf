 A joyful spontaneous world-wide rebellion in which everyone decides we got it wrong and need to start again: no bosses, no jails, no private property, free love. Year 01 of the new order.

Porton (see bibliography) describes the film as "essentially a series of neo-situationist black-out sketches ... somewhat stymied by a rather nebulous utopianism", though exhibiting a "charming gloss on 1968's spirit of negation." (2nd edn, p98)

Included in the CIRA filmography (see bibliography).
