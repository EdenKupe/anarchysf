Comical sf from the heart of hippiedom, in which alien 6 ft blue lobsters seek to take over the world by spiking the drinking water with a drug that causes collective hallucinations on the grand scale.

According to Andrew Nette and Iain McIntyre, in their 2021 _Dangerous Visions and New Worlds. Radical Science Fiction, 1950 to 1985_, Anderson used some of the proceeds from this novel to set up Haight-Ashbury's Communications Company, which printed radical manifestos for the Diggers, the street theatre community anarchists in San Francisco.
