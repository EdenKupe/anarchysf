Centres on members of a teenage street gang  who have to defend themselves from a Guy Fawkes Night attack by  predatory alien invaders on a council estate tower block in south  London.

Reviewed by <a href="http://libcom.org/blog/attack-block-directed-joe-cornish-29102011"> Tom Jennings</a> in _Freedom_ in November 2011, who enjoyed  this "witty, engaging homage to cult alien invasion films", and  appreciated its "intensive local research and an impressive ensemble  of street-cast youngsters," but felt that ". . . the chances for  deeper meaningful connections to be made between contemporary class  stratification and the predicaments which dominate impoverished  urban existence are obliterated in Ali G-style comic relief,  scoffing at stereotypically clich√©d tentative self-criticisms which  are never followed up. Strictly segregating which and whose  understandings have import and practical significance rather than  entertainment value, _Attack the  Block_ thus has far more in common with the safe conservatism  of Spielbergian spectacle . . .
