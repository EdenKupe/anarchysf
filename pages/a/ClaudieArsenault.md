Solarpunk first novel by a writer from Quebec, who  describes it as "a standalone novel sitting firmly between dystopia and  solarpunk and centering LGBTQIAP+ characters", and a hopeful story "about  overcoming desperate odds, nemesis working together, and larger-than-life  characters". It was plugged by Facebook's Solarpunk Anarchist in December 2017.
