Marvel action: corny but successful. Rocha and Rocha's _Joss Whedon, Anarchist_ [see bibliography] gives an anarchist take:
      
"The Avengers are only able to succeed when they work collaboratively without hierarchy. Thus, through the lens of the Avengers, we see that to save the world we require an anarchist society where each person builds upon and follows their own autonomy and works collaboratively for the common good."
