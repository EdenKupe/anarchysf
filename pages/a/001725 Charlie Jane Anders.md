Set on a tidally locked planet, with contrasting cultures and misunderstood aliens. The novel was reviewed by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2019/03/07/review-the-city-in-the-middle-of-the-night-by-charlie-jane-anders/">Zeke Teflon</a> for the Sharp and Pointed blog, in one of his most negative critiques: despite initial expectations that "Anders would have a lot to say politically and socially, that the story would be well crafted, and that there would be at least some humor in it", "Those expectations crashed and burned. This is one of the most ineptly written novels Iâ€™ve ever read. Contrary to expectations, Anders has _nothing_ to say politically or socially. Nothing. And as far as craft? OMG."

His conclusion: "Very much not recommended."

Read without any expectations, it's not quite as bad as Teflon suggests.
