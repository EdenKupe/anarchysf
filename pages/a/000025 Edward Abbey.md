A late sequel to Abbey's better-known _The Monkey Wrench Gang_, published posthumously. This time the eco-sabotage is focused on a gargantuan walking dragline excavator. The novel is really more western than sf.

It was the subject of a <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/337-late-summer-1991/hayduke-lives-too-bad/">review</a> in 1991 by Peter Werbe (writing as Val Salvo) in _Fifth Estate_ #337, in which, while acknowledging the fine nature writing and the quality of 
the opening and closing chapters, he condemns the sexism and racism put into the mouths of some characters; and while he finds compelling Abbey's "howl of protest against what is being done to our fair earth", he also finds the plot irritatingly agenda-driven. Overall, the novel is "greatly flawed."
