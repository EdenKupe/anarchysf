Described by Francis Hines, in his 2021 PhD thesis <a href="https://www.academia.edu/69247545/Evading_Representation_The_Literature_of_Contemporary_U_S_Anarchism">_Evading Representation: The Literature of Contemporary U.S. Anarchism_</a>, 
as "a paranoid and Pynchonian narrative about the development of a government spyware programme and its exposure by San Francisco anarchists," the novel is 
itself written by a collective of San Francisco anarchists, and an anarchist is one of the central characters.

_Darlingtonia_ was reviewed by Ruhe for _Fifth Estate_ in Summer 2018. Finding the novel refreshingly optimistic and highly readable, Ruhe draws a fair parallel with Eggers's _The Circle_, but considers that _Darlingtonia_ "presents a much clearer and more direct critique in its unambiguous stance against the tech economy"; it "succeeds at simply being a good story, avoiding the didactic tendency of much political fiction."
