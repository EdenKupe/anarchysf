A Mars colony is cut off from contact with Earth, and seeks to create a new utopian society from scratch; meanwhile there are parallel stories regarding the discovery that the Martian mountain Olympus Mons is  actually a gigantic sentient being, the quest for the particle we now know to be  the Higgs boson, and the nature of consciousness. As a novel it's a  disappointing failure through trying to cram so much into too small a space. Nevertheless, the utopian aspects have definite interest.

In 2004 the novel was the subject of a half-page review in <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Freedom-2004-01-10.pdf"> <i>Freedom</i></a>, by David Peers. He notes that it "discusses several topics  of interest to anarchists: a small community with few formal structures; a  society that works without using money; ways of discarding previously learned  habits of thought and so on", as well as "How do we deal with crime and  punishment?" Peers concludes: "The obvious science fiction comparison is with  Ursula Le Guin's novel, <em>The Dispossessed</em>. In that book the anarchy was  established and congealing. Here, it's struggling to begin."

Fiona Harrington, in a posting to the Anarchy-SF mailing  list in 2009, found it "a bit disappointing in that it was overly didactic at  the expense of narrative", but "interesting as a novel of ideas and exploration  of how an alternative society would or could work. It is more or less  anarchistic, no formal government but a few authoritarian personalities wield a  degree of influence, also no money!"
