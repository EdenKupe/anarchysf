A prominent writer in the anarchist movement in Montmartre, Adam mainly wrote historical novels, but this is a political story in a future setting. According to <a href="https://www.nyrsf.com/2016/08/brian-stableford-technology-and-liberty-in-french-utopian-fiction.html">Brian Stableford</a>, it "attempts, among other things, to tackle frankly and robustly the question tentatively raised by Déjacque with regard to the abolition of sexual property and the establishment of a culture of total sexual freedom. The story starts from the premise that a disciple of Étienne Cabet disillusioned by the fate of Icarian colonies in the U.S.A., sets out to carry out a similar experiment in the Far East and that the experiment, after overcoming initial difficulties, has been spectacularly successful. Bearing in mind what actually happened to the communities that Cabet and others tried to establish, however, Adam describes a society that has been forced to become extremely authoritarian in order to maintain a theoretical philosophy of liberty, which includes the orgiastic application of complete amorous license."
