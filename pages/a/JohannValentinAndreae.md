Dull Christian utopia, apparently an influence on Bacon's New  Atlantis.
  
 For <a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau: Esbozo">Nettlau</a> this, with the  Bacon and Campanella utopias, "offer  the greatest interest and, [ . . . ] for the organization of work,  of science, of inventions present remarkable perspectives."
  
 <a href="biblio.htm#Berneri">Berneri</a> says:
  
 Throughout his utopia one feels that his love of men inclined him to  trust them as sensible beings capable of going about their lives in  a reliable and honest way, but his religion told him that man is  wicked and has to be carefully guided, preached to and, if  necessary, threatened, to be kept away from sin. That is why his  ideal city is a curious combination of free guilds and religious  tyranny, of personal responsibility and of complete submission to  religion.
