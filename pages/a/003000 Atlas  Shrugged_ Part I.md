Adaptation of the 1957 Ayn Rand novel; parts II and III  were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

 <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/03/11/atlas-shrugged-is-a-the-movie"> Brian Doherty</a>, of Reason magazine, noted that while "the early  reactions from Randians has been positive, with adulation from Rand’s closest  friends and disciples during the years she wrote _Atlas_", by the same  token, "some people who don’t care for Rand have also hated the film." This is  entirely to be expected, given the way Rand divides opinion. I suspect that many  readers of this page will be in the latter camp.
