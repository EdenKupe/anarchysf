Enthusiastically reviewed in Osborne's  Guide. He finds three elements  that libertarians will like: 1) the dominant social tolerance theme,  2) that "this is a terrific parable for the way government divides  people"; and 3) Osborne's perceived parallel between the film's  proposed registration of mutants, and the real world's registration  of guns (once again the crazy American obsession with  gun-ownership!).
