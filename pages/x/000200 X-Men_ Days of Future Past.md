 <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/x-men-days-of-future-past-2014"> Reviewed</a> in 2014 by Margaret Killjoy, who found it "a really good movie",  but "as pacifist as a nun in a Gandhi costume", which for Killjoy was  disappointing: "I just don’t understand why killing is presented as always  wrong".
