Ponderous adaptation of three stories from Ray Bradbury's collection of the same name.

The film was effusively <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/77-april-17-30-1969/the-illustrated-man/">reviewed</a> by Dennis Raymond in _Fifth Estate_ #77, April 1969, for whom it was "a thoughtful, stimulating, and absorbing movieâ€”one that I will return to see again and again."
