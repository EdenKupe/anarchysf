Dystopian Bonnie and Clyde story, set in a future where  ageing is engineered to stop at 25, with longer life only available by the  purchase of time, as the only meaningful currency.

The Anarchism sub-Reddit discussions on top films  advocating anti-capitalism, and movies containing anarchism, both have  recommendations for this film: in the former, one poster says it is  "surprisingly one of the most anti-capitalist films I've ever seen!", while in  the latter one says "I got a socialist vibe from it not even halfway through",  another commenting on its obvious political message.
