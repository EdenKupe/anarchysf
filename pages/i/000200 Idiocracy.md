Satire in which two people take part in an experiment in suspended animation,  only to wake up 500 years later in a vacuous dystopia where commercialism and  anti-intellectualism have run rampant, and society is devoid of any sense of  justice or human rights.

Ilana Mercer describes this film as "my all-time favorite social commentary",  and a "stroke of genius. She, like a good number of commentators, has seen the  parallel with America in 2016/17. Mike Judge himself is on record as saying "I'm  no prophet. I was off by 490 years." [<a href="http://time.com/4327424/idiocracy/">Stein</a>]
