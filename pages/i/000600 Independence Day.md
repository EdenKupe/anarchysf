Invasion by hostile aliens is successfully defeated.

In a _Guardian_ article forwarded to the Anarchy-SF  mailing list in 2004, J.G. Ballard suggested that films such as this might be a  warning to non-Americans, that "the greatest danger is that Americans will  believe their own myths." Mark Bould's 2005 _Socialist Review_ article,  also forwarded to the Anarchy-SF list, rightly identified the film as another  reworking of _The War of the Worlds_, but "In Wells's novel the Martians  are killed by bacteria. In Independence Day Will Smith gets to 'kick ET's butt'.  The gulf could not be wider."
