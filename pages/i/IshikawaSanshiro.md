An anarchist vision of utopia, in  which "The Japan of the year 1996 embodies qualities of Ishikawa's anarchist  philosophy he developed all his life. Ishikawa casts himself as the character of  an old man (120 years-old!) discussing how anarchist revolution had been  achieved in Japan so many years ago." (<a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0098971">Schnick</a>)
 
"He imagined Japanese society organized on a  co-operative basis (with Proudhonist mutual exchange banks) to enable each  individual to live a life of artistic creation. His celebration of nudity  reflected Carpenter's influence, but the idea of retaining the Japanese emperor  as the symbol of communal affection was his very own." (Peter Marshall: 527)
 
Described by Cohn (228) as an  anarchist utopia.
 
The 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket  Diary describes Ishikawa as an anarcho-syndicalist theorist, but  <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0098971"> Schnick</a> suggests he was rather more than that: 
 
Ishikawa believed in a much better  world and hoped that in telling and living his ideal lifestyle, society could  move towards this better world. In this we find Ishikawa's most significant  accomplishment: his practice and ideology were consonant—he lived as he wished  others to live. (p47)
