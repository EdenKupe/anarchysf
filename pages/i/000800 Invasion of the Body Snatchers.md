Alien plant spores have fallen to earth and grown into  large seed pods, each one capable of duplicating a human. As each pod reaches  full development, it assimilates the appearance and persona of each sleeping  person placed near it, but the replicas are without emotion.
 
_Red Planets_ (see Bould, in bibliography) calls the film "A satire on mechanical reproduction, commodification, alienation  and McCarthyism", which about wraps up the allegorical interpretations—according  to <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/invasion_of_the_body_snatchers"> SFE</a>, this is possibly the most discussed B-movie in the history of US  film—but there is evidence that its creators had no allegorical intent.
