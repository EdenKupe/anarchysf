title: "Tiffany Thayer - Doctor Arnoldi"
---

Doctor Arnoldi is an extreme black comedy, in which the premise is that not only do people stop dying, but they become unkillable, so that in very little time at all the world is covered in living corpses, society completely disintegrates, and the survivors enthusiastically embrace cannibalism, before others escape the planet by rocket.

Thayer—perhaps now best remembered as the founder of the Fortean Society—"was a self-styled anarchist, contrarian and atheist", according to [Chris Mikul](http://blackguard23.livejournal.com/119697.html), who gleefully describes this as "one of the most grotesque and repulsive works of science fiction ever written". The novel is described as "notorious" in the 2014 Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary.
