_Doctor Who_ spin-off, featuring a covert agency  called Torchwood which investigates extraterrestrial and supernatural incidents  on Earth.
 
Though the initial two series were seen as "a bit  hit-and-miss" by Iain MacKay (writing as 'Anarcho'), at <a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/captain-jack-gets-all-wobbly"> Anarchist Writers</a>, the third series—a five-part story called 'Children of  Earth'—was welcomed as "well worth watching"; MacKay especially appreciated the  lead character, Captain Jack Harkness, using the Wobbly slogan, 'An injury to  one is an injury to all'. The blogger was editor, in 2011, of _Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Reader_,  and wrote that this story "played havoc with my editing down of System of  Economical Contradictions"!
 
Harkness's pan-sexuality was warmly received by  contributors to the 2015 Aljazeera discussion on '<a href="http://www.stream.aljazeera.com/story/201512101712-0025112">Sci-fi  for social change</a>' in 2015.
