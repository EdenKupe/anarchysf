_The Sea and Summer is_ set in Melbourne in the mid-21st century, with the full impact of global warming in evidence as the oceans rise. The novel is discussed at length in a three-part article by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/australian-science-fiction-great-george-turner-part-i/">Zeke Teflon</a>, who describes it as "the first, or at least the first major, novel to deal head on with climate change"; in another Sharp and Pointed <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/">review</a> he calls it "a literary masterpiece," "the first, and probably best, climate-change-disaster novel."

In _Genetic Soldier_ a starship sent to explore for habitable planets returns to find that the hundreds of years that have passed on Earth since its departure have taken the descendant generations on the home planet in a more ecologically harmonious direction in their absence, don't welcome their return, and quickly find them incompatible with a society determined by rigid genetic specialisation; the starship departs once more. Although
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Teflon</a> considers the novel "decidedly subpar," in his later more extended <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/10/05/australian-science-fiction-great-george-turner-part-iii/">essay</a>, he wrote:

"Interestingly, the one place in Turner’s sci-fi novels where he describes a functional, though small-scale, alternative political/social system–among the “genetics” in _Genetic Soldier_–that system is based upon distinctly anarchist concepts and practices: decentralization, lack of a central coercive authority (i.e., government), voluntary cooperation, and mutual aid. That Turner didn’t see these as attributes of anarchism doesn’t negate the fact that they are.

Viewed from a different angle, _Genetic Soldier_ is distinctive for the centrality to the narrative of the descendants of the aboriginal population, who by the time of the novel have assumed the dominant position in Australian society.
