Vittorio Curtoni in 1978 referred to the first two of  these stories as  "powerful metaphors of the female position in the world of today . . . "
 
In 'Houston, Houston . . . ' a solar flare  sends a three-man space mission 300 years into the future to encounter a  depopulated Earth, with all men wiped out by an epidemic, all survivors being  clones; the men can't cope with an all-female society that has no need for them,  and they are put down. The future society is communalised and libertarian, with  no government as such, but, given the conclusion, surely not entirely benign.  This story is also included in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a>.
 
In 'The Women Men Don't See' a private plane  crashes in the Yucatan; a mother and daughter, among the stranded, choose to be  taken away by passing aliens, feeling that the male society they already live in  couldn't be more alien anyway. More negative than 'Houston, Houston . . . ',  with no more than a suggestion of what might be, it's also a more subtle story.
 
'The Screwfly Solution' is included in the  Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/"> reading list</a>, as is _Brightness Falls from the Air_.
