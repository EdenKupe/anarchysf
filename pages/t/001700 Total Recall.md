Loosely based on a Philip K. Dick story, the film tells of  a man who, in the process of downloading false memories of a trip to Mars and  his experiences as a secret agent there, exposes some real ones, and ends up  leaving Earth and fighting with rebels against a totalitarian Martian  establishment. As with Dick, it's hard to be sure which is the 'real' reality.  Over the top entertainment, which suits Schwarzenegger in the lead role.
