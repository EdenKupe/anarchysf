This, the third film in the _Terminator_ franchise, received a favourable <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Freedom-2003-08-09.pdf">review</a> by Anton Pawluk in _Freedom_ in August 2003. Although the reviewer found it "not very radical stuff", nevertheless "the film does attempt some resolution of the film's concerns with politics and free will, and it shows fighting spirit as it does so." He concludes "And we do learn that the machines triumphed precisely because they had no central core of power. They were cyberspace, a network and because of this they couldn't be destroyed. Had they been listening to the anarchists?"
