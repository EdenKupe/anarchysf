Very Vernian novel by the father of the Soviet Space programme, describing the development and launch of a spaceship by an international group of scientists, their construction of space habitats, and their initial exploration of the solar system. The novel is justifiably referenced in Christopher Clancy's _Fifth Estate_ #411 review of Fred Scharman's _Space Forces: A Critical History of Life in Outer Space_.
