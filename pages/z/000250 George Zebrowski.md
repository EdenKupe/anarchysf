Ambitious novel, set consecutively in (a then future) 2021, 3000, and a hundred billion years in the future: Stapledonian in scale.

Much admired by Wally Conger, for whom it was one of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417185713/http:/wconger.liberty.me/2014/08/10/top-10-sci-fi-liberty-novels-you-probably-havent-read/">Top Ten Sci-Fi Liberty Novels</a>. He wrote:

"_Macrolife_ suggests futures beyond this planet, beyond Old World cultures, beyond governments, beyond authoritarian institutions. It’s utopian but acknowledges the dangers of utopianism. For radical libertarians, freedom-seeking secessionists, and anarcho-transhumanists, it’s worth reading, studying, and seriously discussing."
