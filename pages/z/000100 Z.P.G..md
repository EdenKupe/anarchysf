In a smog-bound overpopulated future, the world's  authorities proclaim a 30-year moratorium on procreation, breach of which  constitutes a capital crime. Would-be parents are provided with animatronic  surrogate offspring. A couple flouts the law.
 
Osborne (see bibliography), while finding  the film dated and low-budget, considers it "nonetheless interesting thanks to  an imaginative story."
