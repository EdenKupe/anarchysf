Superb new wave story viewing a housewife's routine of domestic drudgery as an analogue of entropy itself.

Included in Jesse Cohn's <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1735622/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_ENGL_373_?auto=download">Science Fiction and Fantasy</a> syllabus, and described by him in his 2024 _Hot Equations_ as "a defining text of the New Wave in science fiction and fantasy."

In my view this has to be in the running for the greatest sf short story ever written.
