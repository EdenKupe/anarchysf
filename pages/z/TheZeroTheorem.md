A reclusive computer geek is commissioned by 'The  Management' to work on a formula which would prove that life has no meaning.  Very much in the vein of Brazil. Eccentric, humorous, but darkly bleak.

Listed by Glenn, in <a href="biblio.htm#Bastard">the  BASTARD chronicles</a>, as a subversive film dealing with individual alienation.
