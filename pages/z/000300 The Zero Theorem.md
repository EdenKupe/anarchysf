A reclusive computer geek is commissioned by 'The  Management' to work on a formula which would prove that life has no meaning.  Very much in the vein of _Brazil_. Eccentric, humorous, but darkly bleak.

Listed by Glenn, in <a href="biblio.htm#Bastard">_the  BASTARD chronicles_</a>, as a subversive film dealing with individual alienation.Â
