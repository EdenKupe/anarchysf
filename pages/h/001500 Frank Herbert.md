Herbert was  "immensely  and constantly critical of government", lived on a sustainable land project, and  "developed the idea of technopeasantry, a precursor to post-civilized theory and  the appropriate technology movements" (Killjoy, 2009). The Dune novels were among the first to explore  ecological sf.

Herbert once said "I have a standard axiom:  all governments lie. Don't believe anything they say." (Platt, 1980: 212)

<a href="https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/science-fiction-as-protest-art-part-ii-capitals-infernal-dystopias/">Javier Sethness</a> has made pertinent criticisms of the _Dune_ sequence. While noting that the novels "contain themes critical of ecological destruction and political centralism," he continues that 

"Feuding aristocratic dynasties and capitalist rackets merely reproduce the imperialist depredation our world knows so well, until the messianic figure Duke Paul Atreides [ . . . ] leads the autonomous, 
desert-dwelling, and Arab-coded Fremen in overthrowing the galactic fascism upheld by the Harkonnen and Corrino dynasties.

"That being said, the sequel, _Dune Messiah_ (1969), merely proves the Fremen ecologist Pardot Kynes right: 'No more terrible disaster could befall [one's] people than for them to fall into the hands of a 
Hero.' In this vein, the revolution led by Paul merely reproduces previously-existing authoritarianism, raising it to an even higher level: billions lose their lives, and nearly a hundred planets are sterilized, as the 'fanatic hordes' plunder the universe in his name."

He further notes that Herbert, who he says was was an agent of the US Republican Party, "betrays worrisome fixations with genetics, racialism, caste, myth, and violence in his six _Dune_ novels."

2024's <a href="https://anarchistnews.org/content/anarchist’s-guide-dune">An Anarchist's Guide to Dune</a> gives a thorough account of the degree of Herbert's exposure to anarchism, stressing that though influenced by anarchists, his orientation was actually to what Americans understand as libertarianism. The article, ascribed simply to 'thecollective', (noting that it was the third in the series, _Children of Dune_, that "catapulted him to stardom") concludes that:

"Beyond the critique of religion, _Dune_ is also a giant anarchist parable of power, a Machiavellian opera depicting the clockwork of the tyrants, written by a domestic tyrant. _Hero_ is a bad word in _Dune_, and the freest people in the story, the Fremen, are reduced into the standing army of a hero named Paul Atreides, a eugenic experiment grown autonomous from his masters. As the anarchist saying goes, _no one is fit to rule, and no one deserves to be a slave_, and _Dune_ illustrates this perfectly."
