North of New Guinea an island is discovered and visited,  on which survives the Magdalenian culture of the old stone age. Attempts by an  American expeditionary force to take over are thwarted by a British  archaeological group and the islanders' telepathic powers.
 
This well-meaning book was treated kindly by ADF in _Freedom_, who considered it "worth reading purely as an  emotional record", noting that "Miss Hawkes is obviously wrung by the  inhuman aspects of our culture . . .". (ADF, 1959)
