Heinlein was of the libertarian right, and has been treated harshly by anarchist critics.  For John Pilgrim "the appearance of Heinlein's _Day After Tomorrow_  proved beyond all doubt that Heinlein is that virtually unique creature, a fascist science fiction writer" (1963). Michael Moorcock, similarly, said that if someone sitting opposite him on a tube train were reading _Mein Kampf_ with obvious enjoyment and approval, it probably wouldn't disturb him much more than if it were Heinlein they were reading. Heinlein's later stories, especially, he described as paternalistic, xenophobic, misanthropic, and anti-libertarian. Moorcock  expressed horror at the way radicals were taken in by Heinlein—"even supporters  of the Angry Brigade" being among them; this was perhaps, he suggested, because  Heinlein's vague prose allowed readers to interpret him in the way closest to  their own sympathies.

'Waldo' is briefly mentioned in Moorcock  1978.

_Red Planet_ won the Libertarian  Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1996, as did _Methuselah's Children_  in 1997, _Time Enough for Love_ in 1998, and _Requiem_ in 2003.

Alex Comfort was thinking specifically of  _The Puppet Masters_ when he mused, in 1961, that "it is hard to tell whether  some of the fantasies of science fiction are paranoiac or merely satirical".

For M. Eagle, writing in _Freedom_ in  1969, Heinlein's _Revolt in 2100_ "describes the overthrow of a  theocratic dictatorship in the USA and its replacement by the Covenant, by which all citizens can do anything they wish providing no harm is done to others. A  social contract indeed!"

_Double Star_ is included in Evan  Lampe's <a href="http://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/robert-a-heinlein-double-star-franchise-politics-and-the-virtues-of-empire/"> blog</a>. Easterbrook describes it as "Heinlein's first foray into explicitly  libertarian thought" (p555).

_Citizen of the Galaxy_ won the 2022 Prometheus Hall of Fame award.

_Starship Troopers_ was attacked by both  John Pilgrim and Michael Moorcock, in their seminal articles on anarchism and  science fiction. For Pilgrim it is "one of the very few examples of  retrogressive, one might even say fascist thought, in the entire range of  science fiction writing." He goes on to say that "it could well be argued that  part of the libertarian nature of science fiction is a built-in effect, for the  setting of Heinlein's ideas in a science fiction medium show up, in sharper  relief than mainstream fiction could ever do, the repulsive nature of his  philosophy." (Pilgrim 1963). In 1966 he summed up this novel as "brilliant but  obnoxious". It is of course absolutely central to Moorcock's 1978 'Starship  Stormtroopers', which brackets Heinlein with John Wayne, John Ford, Ronald  Reagan, and George Wallace. He says "To be an anarchist, surely, is to reject  authority but to accept self-discipline and community responsibility. To be a  rugged individualist a la Heinlein and others is to be forever a child who must  obey, charm and cajole to be tolerated by some benign, omniscient father" . . .  .

In 2014 <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/starship-troopers-by-robert-heinlein"> Margaret Killjoy</a> presented a more ambivalent view. On the one hand he argued  that "_Starship Troopers_ is one of the more brilliant and  influential arguments for hierarchy ever put to print. For that reason alone,  it’s worth reading. Know your enemy." But on the other he found himself  irresistibly drawn to the novel's romanticism, as he saw it, and was compelled  to acknowledge that anarchism occupies an awkward liminal space with elements of  both extreme leftwing and extreme rightwing values, which is shared, among  others, with Heinlein.

Eagle, in 1969, found that "_Stranger in a  Strange Land_ contains a beautiful religion or philosophy." The book tied  for the 1987 Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award.

In _Farnham's Freehold_ a nuclear attack  propels a US family into a future society where blacks rule and whites are kept  as slaves and bred for food. Highly offensive and reactionary, it is if anything  worse than _Starship Troopers_. For Moorcock, "It's not such a big step, for  instance, from Farnham's Freehold to Hitler's Lebensraum." (Moorcock 1978) Jesse Cohn, in his 2024 _Hot Equations_, observes that this novel is "also a utopia, a utopia of one man, not unlike the one described by a certain 'real estate developer and president of the Trump Organization'".

'Free Men' received the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2023.

_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ is one of Heinlein's more acceptable books, and one to which a version of anarchism is central—a blend of individualist anarchism and Jeffersonian democracy that Heinlein calls 'rational anarchism'. The story concerns the successful lunar war of independence, and owes much to the historical precedent of the American revolution. For Robert Shea,

 ". . . the picture of an anarchist society on the  moon in _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ is . . . believable. This is one  sort of anarchism, at any rate . . . This Wild West Anarchism wouldn't  appeal to all anarchists, but it does give us a chance to experience one way  that a society without a government might work. Many anarchists like it so much  they suggest it to non-anarchists as introductory reading." (Shea 1980:0)

Like most revolutions, though, the lunar one only results in a substitution at the top.

A key character in _Moon_, Professor  Bernardo de la Paz, is said to have been based on the real-life libertarian  Robert LeFevre, who had been a neighbour of Heinlein's. Ken MacLeod says  this work had an influence on David Friedman and other theorists of  anarcho-capitalism, "a significant minority strand in modern libertarianism" (see MacLeod  2003, in bibliography); but Jeff Riggenbach of the  Mises Institute has suggested that, influential on libertarianism as Heinlein  clearly was, he was probably not a libertarian himself, and that at the time he  was writing works of this period he may well have been under the influence of  his third wife, Virginia. (<a href="http://mises.org/daily/4428">Riggenbach</a>) According to Wendy McElroy, in her book on the agorist Samuel Edward Konkin III, _Moon_ was a principal influence on Konkin himself.

The book tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1983.

_Time Enough for Love_ is a long-winded  and tiresome novel, chronicling the 2360-year life of Lazarus Long, a Heinlein  mouthpiece. There is an objectionable passage, in one of the extracts from  Long's notebooks, which should be committed to memory by anyone inclined to  describe Heinlein as an anarchist:

"Those who refuse to support and defend a state have no  claim to protection by that state. Killing an anarchist or a pacifist should not  be defined as "murder" in a legalistic sense. The offence against the state, if  any, would be "Using deadly weapons inside city limits," or "Creating a traffic  hazard," or "Endangering bystanders," or other misdemeanour." [Second  Intermission]

_Friday_ is better, and certainly  readable. <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/starship-troopers-by-robert-heinlein"> Killjoy</a> comments that "one of the important life lessons he imparts in _Friday_ is that "everyone is bisexual."
 
_For Us, the Living_ was Heinlein's first novel, but  remained unpublished until 2004, after his death. Curiosity value only, really,  but interesting for anyone steeped in Heinlein who wants to see the genesis of  his later work. This is the only Heinlein work included in Bould's _Red Planets_ reading list. Bould refers  to it as "this long-unpublished anti-racist, anti-clerical, nudist utopian  novel, advocating a Social Credit system with which to moderate capitalism", but  also notes its "already problematic feminism."
