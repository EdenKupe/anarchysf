"[. . .] the worst thing about the third part of the Hunger  Games is that there aren’t any hunger games. It’s just a movie about revolution  instead. Considering that the hunger games are an awful thing and revolutions  are something us anarchists are known for encouraging, this is a strange  statement. But frankly, the battle royale under the omniscient gaze of an evil  dictator made for good fiction. 

"Revolution can too, it turns out."
