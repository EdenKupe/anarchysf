title: "Joe Haldeman - The Forever War"
---

The war is not quite forever, but lasts over a thousand  years, and is entirely witnessed, thanks to relativistic effects, by one  trooper; the war (against the Taurans) is unsurprisingly shown to have been  entirely pointless.
 
The Forever War was compared by P.S.,  in the Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review in 1978, with Harrison's  Bill, the Galactic Hero, both books being condemned—unfairly, although  Haldeman's experience as a Vietnam combat veteran means that his descriptions of  warfare sometimes obscure his anti-militarist message. Reviewed and recommended  by <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/the-forever-war-by-joe-haldeman"> Margaret Killjoy</a> in 2014.
