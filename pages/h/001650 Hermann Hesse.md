This long and heavy-going novel is described by John Clute at <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hesse_hermann">SFE</a> as "unequivocally identifiable as sf", yet despite the future setting it doesn't really read as sf. Its interest here is that Alan N. Canton, in his 1974 masters <a href="https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3807&context=etd#:~">thesis</a>, argued that Hesse's political philosophy was essentially anarchism. It can't really be said, however, that this was in any sense explicit.
