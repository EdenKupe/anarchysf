title: "Ninni Holmqvist - The Unit (2006, first published in Swedish as Enhet; first
  English translation 2008)"
---

Dystopian novel set in an institution in which 'dispensable' people—meaning all childless women aged over 50 and men aged over 60—are confined for their organs to be progressively harvested for use outside. Bleak but very moving, and all the more powerful for the apparently sincere compassion shown by the staff of the Unit.
