'Then and Now' was serialised in Benjamin Tucker's _Liberty_, but has never subsequently been published in print form, although it is now available online. Although explicitly anarchist, it barely scrapes in as sf. It's framed as a series of letters from a visitor to a future 200 years from the date of its writing, in which America has become a thriving anarchist society. However, little is really said about this, as the device is mainly used as a vantage point from which to survey the less wholesome world of the 1880s.
