This well-known future-war story, by a team of top-rank  militarists, involves a limited nuclear engagement in which Birmingham and Minsk  are destroyed; the war concludes with Communism wiped off the face of the earth.

A.B., reviewing this novel in the _Cienfuegos Press  Anarchist Review_, found it "one of the crudest, crassest, and most boring  bits of propaganda that have ever been written."
