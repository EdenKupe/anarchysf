Margaret Atwood's dystopia, adapted for the screen. In a  patriarchal theocracy, the tiny minority of fertile women are in effect enslaved  as breeders. After a failed escape, the story follows one woman up to the point  of her next escape, the degree of success of which is left uncertain.

Recommended in Osborne's Guide (see bibliography). For <a href="http://libertarianmovies.net/H/The-Handmaid-s-Tale-1990-.html"> Libertarian Movies</a>, "This film will especially speak to feminist  libertarians, but this nightmare of an ultimate church-state is one that all  libertarians can appreciate!" Also recommended by two posters on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1953qj/have_you_any_movie_recommendations_containing/"> page</a> looking for movie recommendations on Reddit.com/r/Anarchism, though  both preferred the original novel.
