In Haldeman's best-known work, the war is not quite forever, but lasts over a thousand  years, and is entirely witnessed, thanks to relativistic effects, by one  trooper; the war (against the Taurans) is unsurprisingly shown to have been  entirely pointless.

_The Forever War_ was compared by P.S.,  in the _Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review_ in 1978, with Harrison's  _Bill, the Galactic Hero_, both books being condemnedâ€”unfairly, although  Haldeman's experience as a Vietnam combat veteran means that his descriptions of  warfare sometimes obscure his anti-militarist message. Reviewed and recommended  by <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/the-forever-war-by-joe-haldeman"> Margaret Killjoy</a> in 2014.

_Buying Time_ is centred on the monetisation of immortality. The libertarian Eric S. Raymond, in his <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sf-history.html">A Political History of SF</a>, considers that what he describes as the "explicitly anarcho-libertarian future societies" of the Conch Republic and Novysibirsk, which are background features of parts of this novel, "were all the more convincing for not being subjects of polemic."
