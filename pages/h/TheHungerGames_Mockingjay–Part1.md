Second sequel to The Hunger Games, and the first  half of the final part of the trilogy. Katniss reluctantly becomes the symbol of  a mass rebellion against the Capitol, fighting to save the man she loves as well  as the districts in rebellion.
 
 <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-2014"> Reviewed</a> by Margaret Killjoy, who liked the movie, but found it "decidedly  less fun" than its predecessors:
 
[. . .] the worst thing about the third part of the Hunger  Games is that there aren’t any hunger games. It’s just a movie about revolution  instead. Considering that the hunger games are an awful thing and revolutions  are something us anarchists are known for encouraging, this is a strange  statement. But frankly, the battle royale under the omniscient gaze of an evil  dictator made for good fiction. 
Revolution can too, it turns out.
