 Sometimes described as a utopia, but Marie-Louise Berneri correctly described it as belonging to the category of ideal  constitutions rather than ideal commonwealths. She noted—as did Max Nettlau (see Nettlau's _Esbozo_ in bibliography)—its significant influence on  the constitutions of the United States and particularly of Pennsylvania.
