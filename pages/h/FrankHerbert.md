title: "Frank Herbert - Dune novels"
---

Herbert was  "immensely  and constantly critical of government", lived on a sustainable land project, and  "developed the idea of technopeasantry, a precursor to post-civilized theory and  the appropriate technology movements" (<a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy</a>, 2009). The Dune novels were among the first to explore  ecological sf.

Herbert once said "I have a standard axiom:  all governments lie. Don't believe anything they say." (Platt, 1980: 212)
