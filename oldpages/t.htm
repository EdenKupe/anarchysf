<h3>Gabriel Tarde: <i>Underground Man</i> (1905)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Underground Man</i> is a stifling and unpleasant 
authoritarian utopia, set in the far future, after the sun has cooled. For 
Berneri it was &quot;more concerned with the discussion of philosophical ideas than 
the presentation of any ideal commonwealth&quot; (Berneri 1950: 293).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Zeke Teflon (pseud. for Chaz Bufe): <i>Free Radicals: A Novel of Utopia and 
Dystopia</i> (2012)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A fast-paced journey through a series of isolated 
communities of political and religious extremists on a prison planet. One such, 
with which the author&#39;s sympathies clearly lie, is the anarchist community of 
New Harmony.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>William Tenn: 'The Liberation of Earth' (1953)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Vittorio Curtoni saw Tenn as an sf author who &quot;satirizes the mechanics of repression&quot; (Curtoni 1978: 24). This story is a
fine example, in which Earth is repeatedly conquered and reconquered by rival galactic forces, in the course of which
'liberation' the planet is devastated. The tale just stops short of drawing an anarchist moral, in that Earth's indigenous
governors are exempted from description as anything worse than stupid; nevertheless it is most appealing.</p>

			<h3><i>
			<img border="0" src="covers/thingstocome.jpg" width="40" height="54"> Things to Come
			</i>(1936, dir. William Cameron Menzies)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Screenplay by H.G. Wells, based on his 1933 novel <i>The 
Shape of Things to Come.</i> The first part sees the start of World War II in 
Poland, a global Future War that continues for decades; the second, set in 1970, 
deals with a post-war community reduced to tribalism until the arrival of a 
mysterious warlord who proclaims a new era of &#39;law and sanity&#39; and quells the 
opposition with &#39;Peace Gas&#39;; and the third takes place in a gleaming 
technocratic utopian 2036, and an attempt is being made to fire a manned 
projectile into space, using an electric gun. Considered by
<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/things_to_come">SFE</a> &quot;the last 
sf film of any importance until the 1950s&quot; and &quot;one of the most important films 
in the history of sf cinema for the boldness of its ambitions and for the ardour 
with which it projects the myth of space flight as the beginning of humankind&#39;s 
transcendence.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Richard Porton, in his <a href="biblio.htm#Porton">Film 
and the Anarchist Imagination</a>,<i> </i>writes</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">One version of Wells&#39;s technological utopia, albeit a 
cartoonish, hyperbolic variant, can be disinterred from William Cameron 
Menzies&#39;s film <i>Things to Come</i> (1936). Although Wells thought that all of 
his reservations concerning supposedly benign dictatorships were excised from 
the script by Menzies, this fanciful version of scientism run amok is 
undoubtedly the pop culture version of the positivist priesthood postulated by 
thinkers like Comte.</p>
			<h3>D.M. Thomas: <i>The White Hotel</i> (1981)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Pat Flanagan&#39;s 1982 featured <i>Freedom</i> review found the novel 
&quot;a radical failure, <i>as a novel,</i> but the writing often very fine&quot;, and &quot;Thomas is to be admired for the boldness and courage of his endeavour&quot;. Nicolas 
Walter, in a subsequent letter to<i> Freedom, </i>found the book &quot;at the same time a fascinating and coherent work of 
fiction and a funny and convincing critique of psychiatric dogma.&quot; (N.W. 1982)</p>

			<p class="aplaintext">In a dystopian future world below ground, 
			where human activities are wholly controlled by android police 
			officers, use of emotion-suppressing drugs is mandatory, and sex is 
			prohibited, the human THX 1138 makes a bid for freedom, after his

The Time Machine</i> (1960, dir. George Pal)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Dumbed down version of the Wells story.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Mark Bould, in his 2005 <i>Socialist Review </i>article,

melancholy with the lunk-headed machismo of pre-Vietnam US imperialism.&quot;</p>

<h3>James Tiptree, Jr: &#39;The Women Men Don&#39;t See&#39; (1973); &#39;Houston, Houston, Do 
You Read?&#39; (1976); &#39;The Screwfly Solution&#39; (1977, as by Racoona Sheldon);
<i>Brightness Falls from the Air</i> (1985)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Vittorio Curtoni in 1978 referred to the first two of 
these stories as 
&quot;powerful metaphors of the female position in the world of today . . . &quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In &#39;Houston, Houston . . . &#39; a solar flare 
sends a three-man space mission 300 years into the future to encounter a 
depopulated Earth, with all men wiped out by an epidemic, all survivors being 
clones; the men can&#39;t cope with an all-female society that has no need for them, 
and they are put down. The future society is communalised and libertarian, with 
no government as such, but, given the conclusion, surely not entirely benign.

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In &#39;The Women Men Don&#39;t See&#39; a private plane 
crashes in the Yucatan; a mother and daughter, among the stranded, choose to be 
taken away by passing aliens, feeling that the male society they already live in 
couldn&#39;t be more alien anyway. More negative than &#39;Houston, Houston . . . &#39;, 
with no more than a suggestion of what might be, it&#39;s also a more subtle story.</p>

on Earth.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Though the initial two series were seen as &quot;a bit 
hit-and-miss&quot; by Iain MacKay (writing as &#39;Anarcho&#39;), at
<a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/captain-jack-gets-all-wobbly">
Anarchist Writers</a>, the third series—a five-part story called &#39;Children of 
Earth&#39;—was welcomed as &quot;well worth watching&quot;; MacKay especially appreciated the 
lead character, Captain Jack Harkness, using the Wobbly slogan, &#39;An injury to 
one is an injury to all&#39;. The blogger was editor, in 2011, of <i>Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Reader</i>, 
and wrote that this story &quot;played havoc with my editing down of System of 
Economical Contradictions&quot;!</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="covers/totalrecall.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>
Total Recall</i> (1990, dir. Paul Verhoeven)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Loosely based on a Philip K. Dick story, the film tells of 
a man who, in the process of downloading false memories of a trip to Mars and 
his experiences as a secret agent there, exposes some real ones, and ends up 
leaving Earth and fighting with rebels against a totalitarian Martian 
establishment. As with Dick, it&#39;s hard to be sure which is the &#39;real&#39; reality. 
Over the top entertainment, which suits Schwarzenegger in the lead role.</p>

The Toxic Avenger</i> (1984, dirs Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Superhero movie, in which a wimpy janitor falls into a 
barrel of toxic waste and mutates. Supposedly comedy horror, but truly dire and 
utterly humourless. In the words of
<a href="vhttp://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/toxic_avenger_the">SFE</a> &quot;The 
Toxic Avenger&#39;s deliberate tastelessness is uninteresting because pointless.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Bizarrely, <a href="http://alexpeak.com/art/films/tta/">
Alex Peak</a> gives this film an extended right-libertarian critique which is as 
humourless as the film. Troma films, the production company, is said by Logan 
Marie Glitterbomb, of <a href="https://c4ss.org/content/46543">C4SS</a>, to have 
tackled, through the &#39;humor&#39; of this film and others, &quot;issues of racism, 
indigenous rights, animal welfare, queer rights, pollution, devil worshipping 
corporations, and GMO foods with all the blood and nudity one could ask for.&quot;</p>
