This archive is an open-source repository of anarchist or anarchy-adjacent science fiction. Featured on the site are books, movies, and other media which are either anarchist in their politics or of interest to anarchists.

This archive was first collected and organized by [Ben Beck](http://benbeck.co.uk), who gathered and maintained it for the better part of four decades (!) As of 2019, it was redesigned and re-built by Eden Kupermintz and Yanai Sened as a collaborative effort. Eventually, the goal is for a community to help maintain and edit the wealth of knowledge on this site, as well as to add to it (follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/anarchy_sf">Twitter</a> where we aim to organize this community).
